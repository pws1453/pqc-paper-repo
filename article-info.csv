"Status Report on the Second Round of
the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography
Standardization Process","Gorjan Alagic, Jacob Alperin-Sheriff, Daniel Apon",The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process began in 2017 with 69 candidate algorithms that met both the minimum acceptance criteria and submission requirements. The first round lasted until January 2019 during which candidate algorithms were evaluated based on their security performance and other characteristics. NIST selected 26 algorithms to advance to the second round for more analysis. This report describes the evaluation and selection process based on public feedback and internal review of the second-round candidates. The report summarizes the 26 second-round candidate algorithms and identifies those selected to move forward to the third round of the competition. The third-round finalist public-key encryption and key-establishment algorithms are Classic McEliece CRYSTALS-KYBER NTRU and SABER. The third-round finalists for digital signatures are CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM FALCON and Rainbow. These finalists will be considered for standardization at the end of the third round. In addition eight alternate candidate algorithms will also advance to the third round: BIKE FrodoKEM HQC NTRU Prime SIKE GeMSS Picnic and SPHINCS+. These additional candidates are still being considered for standardization although this is unlikely to occur at the end of the third round. NIST hopes that the announcement of these finalists and additional candidates will serve to focus the cryptographic communityâ€™s attention during the next round,NIST,A*,2020,"@misc{257451, author = {Dustin Moody and Gorjan Alagic and Daniel Apon and David Cooper and Quynh Dang and John Kelsey and Yi-Kai Liu and Carl Miller and Rene Peralta and Ray Perlner and Angela Robinson and Daniel Smith-Tone and Jacob Alperin-Sheriff}, title = {Status Report on the Second Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process}, year = {2020}, month = {2020-07-22}, publisher = {NIST Interagency/Internal Report (NISTIR), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD}, doi = {https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8309}, language = {en}, }"
From Weak to Strong Zero-Knowledge and Applications,"Kai-Min Chung, Edward Lui, Rafael Pass",The notion of zero-knowledge [20] is formalized by requiring that for every malicious efficient verifier V * there exists an efficient simulator S that can reconstruct the view of V * in a true interaction with the prover in a way that is indistinguishable to every polynomial-time distinguisher. Weak zero-knowledge weakens this notions by switching the order of the quantifiers and only requires that for every distinguisher D there exists a (potentially different) simulator S D .In this paper we consider various notions of zero-knowledge and investigate whether their weak variants are equivalent to their strong variants. Although we show (under complexity assumption) that for the standard notion of zero-knowledge its weak and strong counterparts are not equivalent for meaningful variants of the standard notion the weak and strong counterparts are indeed equivalent. Towards showing these equivalences we introduce new non-black-box simulation techniques permitting us for instance to demonstrate that the classical 2-round graph non-isomorphism protocol of Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson [18] satisfies a â€œdistributionalâ€ variant of zero-knowledge.Our equivalence theorem has other applications beyond the notion of zero-knowledge. For instance it directly implies the dense model theorem of Reingold et al (STOC â€™08) and the leakage lemma of Gentry-Wichs (STOC â€™11) and provides a modular and arguably simpler proof of these results (while at the same time recasting these result in the language of zero-knowledge).,International Association for Cryptologic Research,A,2015,"@article{chung_lui_pass_2015, title={From weak to strong zero-knowledge and applications}, DOI={10.1007/978-3-662-46494-6_4}, journal={Theory of Cryptography}, author={Chung, Kai-Min and Lui, Edward and Pass, Rafael}, year={2015}, pages={66–92}}"
Post-Quantum Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Accumulators with Applications to Ring Signatures from Symmetric-Key Primitives,"David Derler, Sebastian Ramacher, Daniel Slamanig",In this paper we address the construction of privacy-friendly cryptographic primitives for the post-quantum era and in particular accumulators with zero-knowledge membership proofs and ring signatures. This is an important topic as it helps to protect the privacy of users in online authentication or emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies. Recently we have seen first such constructions mostly based on assumptions related to codes and lattices. We however ask whether it is possible to construct such primitives without relying on structured hardness assumptions but solely based on symmetric-key primitives such as hash functions or block ciphers. This is interesting because the resistance of latter primitives to quantum attacks is quite well understood.In doing so we choose a modular approach and firstly construct an accumulator (with one-way domain) that allows to efficiently prove knowledge of (a pre-image of) an accumulated value in zero-knowledge. We thereby take care that our construction can be instantiated solely from symmetric-key primitives and that our proofs are of sublinear size. Latter is non trivial to achieve in the symmetric setting due to the absence of algebraic structures which are typically used in other settings to make these efficiency gains. Regarding efficient instantiations of our proof system we rely on recent results for constructing efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for general circuits. Based on this building block we then show how to construct logarithmic size ring signatures solely from symmetric-key primitives. As constructing more advanced primitives only from symmetric-key primitives is a very recent field we discuss some interesting open problems and future research directions. Finally we want to stress that our work also indirectly impacts other fields: for the first time it raises the requirement for collision resistant hash functions with particularly low AND count.,Springer International Publishing,0.249 (using last link),2018,"@inproceedings{derler2018post,

A survey on zero knowledge range proofs and applications,"Eduardo Morais, Tommy Koens, Cees van Wijk, Aleksei Koren",In last years there has been an increasing effort to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT) including blockchain. One of the main topics of interest given its importance is the research and development of privacy mechanisms as for example is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP) as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed) Advances in cryptologyâ€”EUROCRYPT 2000 Springer Berlin 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in: Josef (ed) Advances in cryptologyâ€”ASIACRYPT 2008 Springer Berlin 2008) and bulletproofs (BÃ¼nz et al. in: 2018 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP) 2018) proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since bulletproofs (BÃ¼nz et al. 2018) is the most efficient construction we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous schemes but also avoids the trusted setup which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies if the setup phase is compromised it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic ZKP in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements and thus it is not only restricted to ZKRP but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Also we present our implementation which was open sourced (Morais et al. in: Zero knowledge range proof implementation 2018. https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof).,Springer Netherlands,0.13 (using last link),2019,"@article{morais2019survey,

A Survey on Zero-Knowledge Proof in Blockchain,"Xiaoqiang Sun, F. Richard Yu, Peng Zhang, Zhiwei Sun, Weixin Xie, and Xiang Peng",Blockchain which is usually regarded as a public decentralized and distributed ledger has attracted significant attention recently. In the environment of blockchain all historical transaction data are recorded and stored. However because blockchain is open and transparent a malicious user may illegally access private transaction data including transaction amount account address and account balance. As a cryptographic technique zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) can be used to verify whether the prover has enough transaction amount in the environment of blockchain without leaking any private transaction data. This article provides a comprehensive survey on ZKP in the environment of blockchain with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. It first discusses the framework models and applications of ZKP. Next it provides an introduction of blockchain and proposes a framework of ZKP in the environment of blockchain. Then it highlights the current state of ZKP in the environment of blockchain. Finally it identifies some potential problems and future research directions.,IEEE Network,SJR - 2.546 (2020),2021,"""@inproceedings{derler2018post,

Daniel Smith-Tone",In recent years there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers â€“ machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. This Internal Report shares the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)â€™s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography and outlines NISTâ€™s initial plan to move forward in this space. The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.,NIST,SJR - 0.202 (2020),2016,"@misc{chen_jordan _ liu _moody_peralta_perlner_smith-tone_2016, title={Report on post-quantum cryptography - NIST}, url={https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2016/NIST.IR.8105.pdf}, journal={nvlpubs.nist}, publisher={NIST}, author={Chen, Lily and Jordan , Stephen and Liu , Yi-Kai and Moody, Dustin and Peralta, Rene and Perlner, Ray and Smith-Tone, Daniel}, year={2016}, month={Apr}}"
Quantum protocols for zero-knowledge systems,José Cláudio do Nascimento & Rubens Viana Ramos,Zero-knowledge proof system is an important protocol that can be usedas a basic block for construction of other more complex cryptographic protocols. Anintrinsic characteristic of a zero-knowledge systems is the assumption that is impossible for the verifier to show to a third party that he has interacted with the prover.However it has been shown that using quantum correlations the impossibility of transferring proofs can be successfully attacked. In this work we show two new protocolsfor proof transference being the first one based on teleportation and the second onewithout using entangled states. In this last case we assume that the third party can communicate in advance with both verifier and prover. Following we present a quantumzero-knowledge protocol based on quantum bit commitment that can be implementedwith today technology.,Springer New York,H-INDEX 61,2009,"@misc{do nascimento_ramos_2009, title={Quantum protocols for Zero-knowledge systems - quantum information processing}, url={https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11128-009-0127-8}, journal={SpringerLink}, publisher={Springer US}, author={do Nascimento, José Cláudio and Ramos, Rubens Viana}, year={2009}, month={Aug}}"
An authentication protocol based on chaos and zero knowledge proof,"Will Major, William J. Buchanan & Jawad Ahmad",Port Knocking is a method for authenticating clients through a closed stance firewall and authorising their requested actions enabling severs to offer services to authenticated clients without opening ports on the firewall. Advances in port knocking have resulted in an increase in complexity in design preventing port knocking solutions from realising their potential. This paper proposes a novel port knocking solution named Crucible which is a secure method of authentication with high usability and features of stealth allowing servers and services to remain hidden and protected. Crucible is a stateless solution only requiring the client memorise a command the serverâ€™s IP and a chosen password. The solution is forwarded as a method for protecting servers against attacks ranging from port scans to zero-day exploitation. To act as a random oracle for both client and server cryptographic hashes were generated through chaotic systems.,Springer Netherlands,H-INDEX 118,2020,"@misc{major_buchanan_ahmad_2020, title={An authentication protocol based on chaos and zero knowledge proof - nonlinear dynamics}, url={https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11071-020-05463-3#Sec7}, journal={SpringerLink}, publisher={Springer Netherlands}, author={Major, Will and Buchanan, William J. and Ahmad, Jawad}, year={2020}, month={Jan}}"

An enhanced Kerberos protocol with non-interactive Zero Konowledge Proof,"Zhu, Yuesheng; Ma, Limin; Zhang, Jinjiang.",As one of the most important trusted third-party-based authentication protocols Kerberos is widely used to provide authentication service in distributed networks. However it is vulnerable to common brute force password-guessing attacks because of its password-based mechanism.

Cyber Security in the Quantum Era,Petros Wallden Elham Kashefi,CYBER SECURITY DEALS with the protection of computer systems from attacks that could compromise the hardware software or information. These attacks by allowing unauthorized use could leak private information and cause damage or disruption. In the future the part of everyday life and economy requiring computer systems is bound to increase further and become fully dominant. Cyber warfare and cyber crime will be common and the role of cyber security crucial. SINCE THE COMPUTER systems (and attackers) evolve both in hardware and software the constant evolution of this field is of high importance. Arguably the most dramatic development that one can envision is a change in the paradigm of computational model used. Quantum technologies appear to bring us close to such a change. Here we explore the research field that lies on the intersection of cyber security and quantum technologies research.,Communications of the acm,SJR - 1.204 (2019),2019,"@misc{wallden_kashefi_2019, title={Cyber security in the Quantum Era}, url={https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3241037}, journal={Communications of the ACM}, publisher={ACM}, author={Wallden, Petros and Kashefi, Elham}, year={2019}, month={Apr}}"

Implementation of real estate contract system using zero knowledge proof algorithm based blockchain,SoonHyeong Jeong & Byeongtae Ahn,A real estate contract is a high-risk contract with a large amount of money and there are many problems in the risk and reliability of fraud. In particular online contracts have low reliability and high risk. If you can manage information on these issues and prevent forgery and duplication of contract information you can maintain low cost and high efficiency. Blockchain technology is being used as an alternative to the enormous cost and reliability issues associated with offline real estate contracts. When blockchain technology is applied to an online contract management system reliability and scalability are efficient and confidentiality can be ensured. However as real estate transactions using blockchain technology increase online problems arise in scalability. Therefore in this paper we implemented an Ethereum-based online real estate contract system that solved the scalability using the zero-knowledge proof algorithm. The real estate contract system enables online contract management and discrimination of contract forgery through blockchain. In particular it was possible to prevent fraud until the contract was concluded and the contract was terminated.,The journal of supercomputing,B,2021,"@article{jeong_ahn_2021, title={Implementation of real estate contract system using zero knowledge proof algorithm based blockchain}, volume={77}, DOI={10.1007/s11227-021-03728-1}, number={10}, journal={The Journal of Supercomputing}, author={Jeong, SoonHyeong and Ahn, Byeongtae}, year={2021}, pages={11881–11893}}"

Zero-knowledge proof systems for QMA,"Anne Broadbent, Zhengfeng Ji, Fang Song, John Watrous",Prior work has established that all problems in NP admit classical zero-knowledge proof systems and under reasonable hardness assumptions for quantum computations these proof systems can be made secure against quantum attacks. We prove a result representing a further quantum generalization of this fact which is that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum zero-knowledge proof system. More specifically assuming the existence of an unconditionally binding and quantum computationally concealing commitment scheme we prove that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum interactive proof system that is zero-knowledge with respect to efficient quantum computations. Our QMA proof system is sound against arbitrary quantum provers but only requires an honest prover to perform polynomial-time quantum computations provided that it holds a quantum witness for a given instance of the QMA problem under consideration. The proof system relies on a new variant of the QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem in which the local terms are described by Clifford operations and standard basis measurements. We believe that the QMA-completeness of this problem may have other uses in quantum complexity.,IEEE (FOCS),A*,2016,"@inproceedings{broadbent2016zero,

QMA-hardness of Consistency of Local Density Matrices with Applications to Quantum Zero-Knowledge,"Anne Broadbent, Alex B. Grilo",We provide several advances to the understanding of the class of Quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems (QMA) the quantum analogue of NP. Our central contribution is proving a longstanding conjecture that the Consistency of Local Density Matrices (CLDM) problem is QMA-hard under Karp reductions. The input of CLDM consists of local reduced density matrices on sets of at most k qubits and the problem asks if there is an n-qubit global quantum state that is locally consistent with all of the k-qubit local density matrices. The containment of this problem in QMA and the QMA-hardness under Turing reductions were proved by Liu [APPROX-RANDOM 2006]. Liu also conjectured that CLDM is QMA-hard under Karp reductions which is desirable for applications and we finally prove this conjecture. We establish this result using the techniques of simulatable codes of Grilo Slofstra and Yuen [FOCS 2019] simplifying their proofs and tailoring them to the context of OMA. In order to develop applications of CLDM we propose a framework that we call locally simulatable proofs for QMA: this provides QMA proofs that can be efficiently verified by probing only k qubits and furthermore the reduced density matrix of any k-qubit subsystem of a good witness can be computed in polynomial time independently of the witness. Within this framework we show several advances in zero-knowledge in the quantum setting. We show for the first time a commit-and-open computational zero-knowledge proof system for all of QMA as a quantum analogue of a â€œsigmaâ€ protocol. We then define a Proof of Quantum Knowledge which guarantees that a prover is effectively in possession of a quantum witness in an interactive proof and show that our zero-knowledge proof system satisfies this definition. Finally we show that our proof system can be used to establish that QMA has a quantum non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system in the secret parameter setting.,IEEE (FOCS),A*,2020,"@inproceedings{broadbent2020qma,

The cryptographic security is assured as long the GSDP problem is computationally hard to solve in non-commutative algebraic structures and belongs currently to the PQC category as no quantum computer attack is likely to exists.,CoRR,B,2017,"@article{DBLP:journals/corr/Hecht17b,

Image based authentication using zero-knowledge protocol,Zarina Mohamad; Lim Yan Thong; Aznida Hayati Zakaria; Wan Suryani Wan Awang,One of the most critical concerns in information security today is user authentication. There is a great security when using the text-based strong password schemes but often remembering those good passwords is very hard and users writing them down on a piece of paper or saving inside the smart phone. There is an alternative solution to the text-based authentication which is the Graphical User Authentication (GUA) or simply image-based Password based on the fact that humans tend to memorize images better. This type of approach allows users to create and remember passwords easily. However one big issues that is plaguing GUA is shoulder surfing attack that can capture the users mouse clicks and eavesdropping. In this paper a new algorithm that using zero-knowledge protocol as the solution to solving the eavesdropping and shoulder surfing attack to provide better system security. In zero-knowledge protocol users prove that they know the graphical password without sending it. In other words the user does not send the password to the verifier or reveal it to the people nearby. Hackers who try to eavesdrop the password will be failed since the password is not sent over the insecure channel such as Internet nor reveal. Therefore it is a secured approach to prevent interception by unwanted parties or adversary. The result that is going to be yielded in this project is a secured authentication approach which is user-friendly.without revealing anything other than the veracity of the statement tobe proven. After a formal definition of zero-knowledge proof schemesand a simple example zero-knowledge proofs for Graph Isomorphismand Graph 3-colorability are presented the latter being the basis forthe proof that all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs. Thepaper concludes with an application of zero-knowledge proofs in cryptography the Fiat-Shamir Indentification Protocol which is the basisfor modern zero-knowledge entity authentication schemes.,2018 4th International Conference on Computer and Technology Applications (ICCTA),,2018,"@INPROCEEDINGS{8398683,

"A zero-knowledge-proof-based digital

IoT security system with modified Zero Knowledge Proof algorithm for authentication,"Benfano Soewito, Yonathan Marcellinus",It has been predicted that more devices will be connected to the internet network along with the development of IoT and that will increase the complexity in the security system. The most important thing in security systems is the process of encryption and authentication. Various encryption techniques are developed to overcome security problems of the data. One of the methods used for authentication of data is Zero Knowledge Proof. This method works to identify the authenticity of someones statement to proof without showing any knowledge of the statement mentioned. This research will mainly discuss about the security of data transmission system by combining data encryption and data authentication. The proposed data encryption is using Advanced Encryption System and method for authentication of data using the Zero Knowledge Proof. This research will conduct the development methods of authentication Zero Knowledge Proof from previous research and the result was compared with the proposed method based on the simulation results transmission system client and server. Experiments will be conducted using thirty-text data each of data will be measured on the performance of both encryption and authentication process between the previous method and proposed method.

Privacy methods and zero-knowledge poof for corporate blockchain,"Anatoly Konkin, Sergey Zapechnikov",Nowadays distributed ledger technology or blockchain is widely used in the corporate sector for various industries. Although implementation issues (coding practice lack of capabilities etc.) are not among the major barriers for the technology adaption there are still some informational security challenges to adjust and scale blockchain networks for corporate usage. One of them is to provide functionality for private transactions stored in a blockchain. Some methods including mix networks ring signatures and off-chain protocols were applied to meet the privacy requirements. However these methods have some limitations associated with the key blockchain characteristics such as decentralized storing system and immutability verification of private data. This article examines zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) methods for corporate blockchain networks. The article provides the review of existing methods for private transactions discovers the implementation of ZKP methods also performance and scalability issues are discussed.,Procedia Computer Science,"H-INDEX

Perfect zero knowledge for quantum multiprover interactive proofs,"Alex B. Grilo, William Slofstra, Henry Yuen",In this work we consider the interplay between multiprover interactive proofs quantum entanglement and zero knowledge proofs - notions that are central pillars of complexity theory quantum information and cryptography. In particular we study the relationship between the complexity class MIP* the set of languages decidable by multiprover interactive proofs with quantumly entangled provers and the class PZK-MIP* which is the set of languages decidable by MIP* protocols that furthermore possess the perfect zero knowledge property. Our main result is that the two classes are equal i.e. MIP* = PZK-MIP*. This result provides a quantum analogue of the celebrated result of Ben-Or Goldwasser Kilian and Wigderson (STOC 1988) who show that MIP = PZK-MIP (in other words all classical multiprover interactive protocols can be made zero knowledge). We prove our result by showing that every MIP* protocol can be efficiently transformed into an equivalent zero knowledge MIP* protocol in a manner that preserves the completeness-soundness gap. Combining our transformation with previous results we obtain the corollaries that i) all languages that can be solved in non-deterministic double exponential time have zero knowledge MIP* protocols and ii) all co-recursively enumerable languages (which include undecidable problems as well as all decidable problems) have zero knowledge MIP* protocols with vanishing promise gap.,IEEE (FOCS),A*,2019,"@inproceedings{grilo2019perfect,

On the Concurrent Composition of Quantum Zero-Knowledge,"Prabhanjan Ananth, Kai-Min Chung, Rolando L. La Placa",Abstract. We study the notion of zero-knowledge secure against quantum polynomial-time verifiers (referred to as quantum zero-knowledge)in the concurrent composition setting. Despite being extensively studiedin the classical setting concurrent composition in the quantum settinghas hardly been studied.We initiate a formal study of concurrent quantum zero-knowledge.Our results are as follows:â€“ Bounded Concurrent QZK for NP and QMA: Assuming postquantum one-way functions there exists a quantum zero-knowledgeproof system for NP in the bounded concurrent setting. In this setting we fix a priori the number of verifiers that can simultaneouslyinteract with the prover. Under the same assumption we also showthat there exists a quantum zero-knowledge proof system for QMAin the bounded concurrency setting.â€“ Quantum Proofs of Knowledge: Assuming quantum hardnessof learning with errors (QLWE) there exists a bounded concurrentzero-knowledge proof system for NP satisfying quantum proof ofknowledge property.Our extraction mechanism simultaneously allows for extraction probability to be negligibly close to acceptance probability(extractability) and also ensures that the proverâ€™s state after extraction is statistically close to the proverâ€™s state after interacting withthe verifier (simulatability).Even in the standalone setting the seminal work of [Unruh EUROCRYPTâ€™12] and all its followups satisfied a weaker version ofextractability property and moreover did not achieve simulatability. Our result yields a proof of quantum knowledge system for QMAwith better parameters than prior works.,Springer - Lecture Notes in Computer Science,SJR-0.249,2021,"@inproceedings{ananth2021concurrent,

Zilch: A Framework for Deploying Transparent Zero-Knowledge Proofs,Dimitris Mouris; Nektarios Georgios Tsoutsos,As cloud computing becomes more popularresearch has focused on usable solutions to the problem ofverifiable computation (VC) where a computationally weakdevice (Verifier) outsources a program execution to a power-ful server (Prover) and receives guarantees that the executionwas performed faithfully. A Prover can further demonstrateknowledge of a secret input that causes the Verifierâ€™s programto satisfy certain assertions without ever revealing which inputwas used. State-of-the-art Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge(ZKPK) methods encode a computation using arithmetic circuitsand preserve the privacy of Proverâ€™s inputs while attestingthe integrity of program execution. Nevertheless developingdebugging and optimizing programs as circuits remains a daunt-ing task as most users are unfamiliar with this programmingparadigm. In this work we present Zilch a framework that accel-erates and simplifies the deployment of VC and ZKPK for anyapplication transparently i.e. without the need of trusted setup.Zilch uses traditional instruction sequences rather than staticarithmetic circuits that would need to be regenerated for eachdifferent computation. Towards that end we have implementedZ MIPS: a MIPS-like processor model that allows verifying eachinstruction independently and compose a proof for the executionof the target application. To foster usability Zilch incorporates anovel cross-compiler from an object-oriented Java-like languagetailored to ZKPK and optimized our Z MIPS model as well as apowerful API that enables integration of ZKPK within existingC/C++ programs. In our experiments we demonstrate theflexibility of Zilch using two real-life applications and evaluateProver and Verifier performance on a variety of benchmarks,IEEE transactions on information forensics and security,,2021,"@ARTICLE{9410618,

A Complete Privacy-Preserving Credit Score System Using Blockchain and Zero Knowledge Proof,Yuye Han; Hong Chen; Zhijie Qiu; Lei Luo; Gongbin Qian,As an essential means of privacy protection technology zero-knowledge proof has gradually been applied into various fields with the development of blockchain technology such as the Internet of Vehicles and Bitcoin. Personal comprehensive credit score as a measure to promote social governance is closely related to personal privacy. Although there are currently credit score calculation systems for various application scenarios these systems almost ignore user privacy protection which leads to user information leakage or abuse. The combination of zero-knowledge proof and personal credit score calculation has been studied by a number of researchers at the present stage. However all data are provided by users directly in the current schemes which did not consider the data authenticity under the situation that users provided false data. In this paper we utilize zero-knowledge proof to design a novel privacy protection scheme for personal credit score calculation taking into account the authenticity verification of multi-dimensional user data. In addition our scheme also proposes the concept of a universal verification platform based on blockchain for personal credit scores. This platform has more substantial applicability and versatility for any qualified institution that requires querying and verifying userâ€™s credit scores. At the end of the paper we conducted a security analysis and performance evaluation for the overall scheme.,2021 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data),,2021,"@INPROCEEDINGS{9671494,

On Using zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs in Blockchain-Based Identity Management,"Andreea-Elena Panait, Ruxanadra F. Olimid",One possible applicability of blockchain technology is in identity management. Especially for public blockchains the need to reduce (ideally to zero) the exposure of sensitive identification data is clear. Under these settings zero-knowledge proofs in particular in the advanced forms of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) and Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge (zk-STARK) can be used as a potential privacy-preserving technique. The current work looks at the existing libraries that implement zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs and exemplifies and discusses the use of zk-SNARKs in blockchain-based identity management solutions.,LNCS,,2021,"Panait AE., Olimid R.F.

"Scalable, Transparent, and Post-Quantum Secure Computational Integrity","Eli Ben-Sasson, Iddo Bentov, Yinon Horesh, Michael Riabzev",Human dignity demands that personal information like medical and forensic data be hidden from the public. But veils of secrecy designed to preserve privacy may also be abused to cover up lies and deceit by institutions entrusted with Data unjustly harming citizens and eroding trust in central institutions. Zero knowledge (ZK) proof systems are an ingenious cryptographic solution to this tension between the ideals of personal privacy and institutional integrity enforcing the latter in a way that does not compromise the former. Public trust demands transparency from ZK systems meaning they be set up with no reliance on any trusted party and have no trapdoors that could be exploited by powerful parties to bear false witness. For ZK systems to be used with Big Data it is imperative that the public verification process scale sublinearly in data size. Transparent ZK proofs that can be verified exponentially faster than data size were first described in the 1990s but early constructions were impractical and no ZK system realized thus far in code (including that used by crypto-currencies like Zcashâ„¢) has achieved both transparency and exponential verification speedup simultaneously for general computations. Here we report the first realization of a transparent ZK system (ZK-STARK) in which verification scales exponentially faster than database size and moreover this exponential speedup in verification is observed concretely for meaningful and sequential computations described next. Our system uses several recent advances on interactive oracle proofs (IOP) such as a â€œfastâ€ (linear time) IOP system for error correcting codes. Our proof-of-concept system allows the Police to prove to the public that the DNA profile of a Presidential Candidate does not appear in the forensic DNA profile database maintained by the Police. The proof which is generated by the Police relies on no external trusted party and reveals no further information about the contents of the database nor about the candidateâ€™s profile. In particular no DNA information is disclosed to any party outside the Police. The proof is shorter than the size of the DNAdatabase and verified faster than the time needed to examine that database naÂ¨Ä±vely,Israel Science Foundation,,2018,"@misc{cryptoeprint:2018:046, author = {Eli Ben-Sasson and Iddo Bentov and Yinon Horesh and Michael Riabzev}, title = {Scalable, transparent, and post-quantum secure computational integrity}, howpublished = {Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2018/046}, year = {2018}, note = {\url{https://ia.cr/2018/046}}, }"
On the obfuscatability of quantum point functions,"Tao Shang, Ran-yi-liu Chen, Jian-wei Liu",The goal of this work is to provide a positive result of quantum obfuscation. Point functions have been widely discussed in classical obfuscation theory but yet not formally defined in the quantum setting. To analyze the obfuscatability of quantum point functions we start with preliminaries on quantum obfuscation giving out the oracleimplementable relationship of two quantum circuit families and some obfuscations o combined quantum circuits. Then we present the strict definition of a quantum point function and discuss its variants of multiple points and multiple qubits. Under the quantum-accessible random oracle model we obtain the obfuscatability of quantum point function families by means of reduction. Finally we discuss the application of quantum obfuscation in quantum zero-knowledge. As a start of study on quantum point functions our work will be inspiring in the future development of quantum obfuscation theory.,Quantum Information Processing (Springer),SJR- 0.583,2019,"@article{shang2019obfuscatability,

Scalable Zero Knowledge with No Trusted Setup,"Eli Ben-Sasson, Iddo Bentov, Yinon Horesh, Michael Riabzev",One of the approaches to constructing zero knowledge (ZK) arguments relies on â€œPCP techniquesâ€ that date back to influential works from the early 1990â€™s [Babai et al. Arora et al. 1991-2]. These techniques require only minimal cryptographic assumptions namely the existence of a family of collision-resistant hash functions [Kilian STOC 1992] and achieve two remarkable properties: (i) all messages generated by the verifier are public random coins and (ii) total verification time is merely poly-logarithmic in the time needed to naÃ¯vely execute the computation being verified [Babai et al. STOC 1991]. Those early constructions were never realized in code mostly because proving time was too large. To address this the model of interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) which generalizes the PCP model was recently suggested. Proving time for ZK-IOPs was reduced to quasi-linear even for problems that require nondeterministic exponential time to decide [Ben-Sasson et al. TCC 2016 ICALP 2017]. Despite these recent advances it was still not clear whether ZK-IOP systems can lead to concretely efficient succinct argument systems. Our main claim is that this is indeed the case. We present a new construction of an IOP of knowledge (which we call a zk-STIK) that improves asymptotically on the state of art: for log-space computations of length T it is the first to   ð‘‚(ð‘‡logð‘‡)  arithmetic prover complexity and   ð‘‚(logð‘‡)  verifier arithmetic complexity. Prior IOPs had additional   ð—‰ð—ˆð—…ð—’logð‘‡  factors in both prover and verifier. Additionally we report a C++ realization of this system (which we call libSTARK). Compared to prevailing ZK realizations it has the fastest proving and (total) verification time for sufficiently large sequential computations.,International Association for Cryptologic Research,SJR- 2.21,2019,"@misc{cryptoeprint:2018:046, author = {Eli Ben-Sasson and Iddo Bentov and Yinon Horesh and Michael Riabzev}, title = {Scalable Zero Knowledge with No Trusted Setup

Post-Quantum Authentication in TLS 1.3: A Performance Study,Dimitrios Sikeridis and Panos Kampanakis and Michael Devetsikiotis,The potential development of large-scale quantum computers is raising concerns among IT and security research professionals due to their ability to solve (elliptic curve) discrete logarithm and integer factorization problems in polynomial time. All currently used public key algorithms would be deemed insecure in a post-quantum (PQ) setting. In response the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a process to standardize quantum-resistant crypto algorithms focusing primarily on their security guarantees. Since PQ algorithms present significant differences over classical ones their overall evaluation should not be performed out-of-context. This work presents a detailed performance evaluation of the NIST signature algorithm candidates and investigates the imposed latency on TLS 1.3 connection establishment under realistic network conditions. In addition we investigate their impact on TLS session throughput and analyze the trade-off between lengthy PQ signatures and computationally heavy PQ cryptographic operations. Our results demonstrate that the adoption of at least two PQ signature algorithms would be viable with little additional overhead over current signature algorithms. Also we argue that many NIST PQ candidates can effectively be used for less time-sensitive applications and provide an in-depth discussion on the integration of PQ authentication in encrypted tunneling protocols along with the related challenges improvements and alternatives. Finally we propose and evaluate the combination of different PQ signature algorithms across the same certificate chain in TLS. Results show a reduction of the TLS handshake time and a significant increase of a servers TLS tunnel connection rate over using a single PQ signature scheme.,Cryptology ePrint Archive,,2020,"@misc{cryptoeprint:2020:071, author = {Dimitrios Sikeridis and Panos Kampanakis and Michael Devetsikiotis}, title = {Post-Quantum Authentication in TLS 1.3: A Performance Study}, howpublished = {Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2020/071}, year = {2020}, note = {\url{https://ia.cr/2020/071}}, }"
"A Black-Box Approach to Post-Quantum
Zero-Knowledge in Constant Rounds","Nai-Hui Chia, Kai-Min Chung, and Takashi Yamakawa",In a recent seminal work Bitansky and Shmueli (STOC â€™20)gave the first construction of a constant round zero-knowledge argumentfor NP secure against quantum attacks. However their constructionhas several drawbacks compared to the classical counterparts. Specifi-cally their construction only achieves computational soundness requiresstrong assumptions of quantum hardness of learning with errors (QLWEassumption) and the existence of quantum fully homomorphic encryp-tion (QFHE) and relies on non-black-box simulation.In this paper we resolve these issues at the cost of weakening thenotion of zero-knowledge to what is called -zero-knowledge.

Post-quantum Resettably-Sound Zero Knowledge,"Nir Bitansky, Michael Kellner, Omri Shmueli",We study post-quantum zero-knowledge (classical) protocols that are sound against quantum resetting attacks. Our model is inspired by the classical model of resetting provers (Barak-Goldreich-Goldwasser-Lindell FOCS â€˜01) providing a malicious efficient prover with oracle access to the verifierâ€™s next-message-function fixed to some initial random tape; thereby allowing it to effectively reset (or equivalently rewind) the verifier. In our model the prover has quantum access to the verifierâ€™s function and in particular can query it in superposition.The motivation behind quantum resettable soundness is twofold: First ensuring a strong security guarantee in scenarios where quantum resetting may be possible (e.g. smart cards or virtual machines). Second drawing intuition from the classical setting we hope to improve our understanding of basic questions regarding post-quantum zero knowledge.We prove the following results: Black-Box Barriers. Quantum resetting exactly captures the power of black-box zero knowledge quantum simulators. Accordingly resettable soundness cannot be achieved in conjunction with black-box zero knowledge except for languages in ððð. Leveraging this we prove that constant-round public-coin or three message protocols cannot be black-box post-quantum zero-knowledge. For this we show how to transform such protocols into quantumly resettably sound ones. The transformations are similar to classical ones but their analysis is very different due to the essential difference between classical and quantum resetting.  A Resettably-Sound Non-Black-Box Zero-Knowledge Protocol. Under the (quantum) Learning with Errors assumption and quantum fully-homomorphic encryption we construct a post-quantum resettably-sound zero knowledge protocol for ðð. We rely on non-black-box simulation techniques thus overcoming the black-box barrier for such protocols.  From Resettable Soundness to The Impossibility of Quantum Obfuscation. Assuming one-way functions we prove that any quantumly-resettably-sound zero-knowledge protocol for ðð implies the impossibility of quantum obfuscation.

Blockchain-based secure Handover for IoT using Zero-Knowledge Proof protocol,"Samia Boutalbi, Julio César Pérez Carcía, Abderrahim Benslimane",Currently the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used by the emerging of internet-integrated wireless devices in daily life. In order to communicate and exchange data with each other IoT devices must pass by a gateway that belongs to the same network. But considering the mobility of such devices and their constraints it becomes difficult to trust and to connect from a gateway to another. Therefore this paper introduces a blockchain-based secure handover protocol. It ensures an anonymous mutual authentication solution between a mobile IoT device and a visited gateway by using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocol. To do simulations have been performed thanks to a discrete events simulator. In addition to a good security level compared with the most used protocol (DTLS) our simulation results lead to better performance in terms of temporal complexity energy consumption and communication cost.,IEEE (GLOBECOM),A,2021,"@misc{boutalbi_pérez carcía_benslimane, title={Blockchain-based secure handover for IOT using zero-knowledge proof protocol}, url={https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9685733/authors#authors}, journal={IEEE Xplore}, publisher={IEEE}, author={Boutalbi, Samia and Pérez Carcía, Julio César and Benslimane, Abderrahim}}"
Picnic,"Deepraj Soni, Kanad Basu, Mohammed Nabeel, Najwa Aaraj, Marcos Manzano, Ramesh Karri",Picnic is a hash-based cryptographic algorithm which claims to provide a signature scheme that is unforgeable against quantum computers; it is the seventh such algorithm we consider in-depth of the eight in this book. This algorithm is divided into three components: key generation signature generation and signature verification. We select three variants of Picnic with distinct security strength and make these variants capable of synthesis by a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool. We summarize all the changes in the C code to make it capable of synthesis. Using HLS we generate FPGA and ASIC designs for all three components of the three variants. We evaluate power area speed and security parameter trade-offs for Picnic hardware architectures. We explore the design-space through a detailed analysis of FPGA and ASIC designs for Picnic concluding that for the FPGA implementation latency increases with security but with minimal change in hardware overhead while for the ASIC-specific implementation the baseline version provides the best throughput at security level 1 but for security levels 3 and 5 the pipelined implementations have shorter execution times.,Springer International Publishing,SJR - 2.394,2020,"@misc{springerlink_2020, title={Picnic | SpringerLink}, url={https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-57682-0_8}, journal={springerLink}, publisher={springerLink}, year={2020}, month={Oct}}"
A survey on zero knowledge range proofs and applications,"Eduardo Morais Tommy Koens
Cees van Wijk Aleksei Koren",In last years there has been an increasing efort to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT) including blockchain.One of the main topics of interest given its importance is the research and development of privacy mechanisms as forexample is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide informa-tion that is put into the ledger while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe diferentstrategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP) as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed)Advances in cryptologyâ€”EUROCRYPT 2000 Springer Berlin 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in:Josef (ed) Advances in cryptologyâ€”ASIACRYPT 2008 Springer Berlin 2008) and bulletproofs (BÃ¼nz et al. in: 2018 IEEEsymposium on security and privacy (SP) 2018) proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possibleuse cases. Since bulletproofs (BÃ¼nz et al. 2018) is the most efcient construction we will give a detailed description of itsalgorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efcient than previous schemes but also avoids the trustedsetup which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies ifthe setup phase is compromised it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly bulletproofs canalso be used to construct generic ZKP in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements and thus it is not onlyrestricted to ZKRP but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerfultool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP.

Adoption of Lamport signature scheme to implement digital signatures in IoT,"Ghazi Muhammad Abdullah, Quzal Mehmood, Chaudry Bilal Ahmad Khan",The adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology is increasing at a fast rate. With improving software technologies and growing security threats there is always a need to upgrade the firmware in the IoT devices. Digital signatures are an integral part of digital communication to cope with the threat of these devices being exploited by attackers to run malicious commands codes or patches on them. Digital Signatures measure the authenticity of the transmitted data as well as are a source of record keeping (repudiation).

Post-Quantum Zero-Knowledge and Signatures from Symmetric-Key Primitives,"Melissa Chase

Christian Rechberger
Daniel Slamanig
Greg Zaverucha",We propose a new class of post-quantum digital signature schemes that: (a) derive their security entirely from the security of symmetric-key primitives believed to be quantum-secure and (b) have extremely small keypairs and (c) are highly parameterizable. In our signature constructions the public key is an image y =f (x) of a one-way function f and secret key x. A signature is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of x that incorporates a message to be signed. For this proof we leverage recent progress of Giacomelli et al. (USENIXâ€™16) in constructing an efficient Î£-protocol for statements over general circuits. We improve this Î£-protocol to reduce proof sizes by a factor of two at no additional computationalcost. While this is of independent interest as it yields more compact proofs for any circuit it also decreases our signature sizes. We consider two possibilities to make the proof non-interactive: the Fiat-Shamir transform and Unruhâ€™s transform (EUROCRYPTâ€™12 â€™15â€™16). The former has smaller signatures while the latter has a security analysis in the quantum-accessible random oracle model. By customizing Unruhâ€™s transform to our application the overhead is reduced to 1.6x when compared to the Fiat-Shamir transform which does not have a rigorous post-quantum security analysis. We implement and benchmark both approaches and explore the possible choice of f  taking advantage of the recent trend to strive for practical symmetric ciphers with a particularly low number of multiplications and end up using LowMC (EUROCRYPTâ€™15),Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,SJR - 0.880,2017,"@misc{chase_derler_goldfeder_orlandi_ramacher_rechberger_slamanig_zaverucha_2017, title={Post-quantum Zero-knowledge and signatures from symmetric-key primitives: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security}, url={https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3133956.3133997}, journal={ACM Conferences}, publisher={Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security}, author={Chase, Melissa and Derler, David and Goldfeder, Steven and Orlandi, Claudio and Ramacher, Sebastian and Rechberger, Christian and Slamanig, Daniel and Zaverucha, Greg}, year={2017}, month={Oct}}"
"Improved Non-Interactive Zero Knowledge with Applications
to Post-Quantum Signatures","Jonathan KatzVladimir KolesnikovXiao Wang",Recent work including ZKBoo ZKB++ and Ligero has developed efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge (NIZKPoKs) for Boolean circuits based on symmetric-key primitives alone using the â€œMPC-in-the-headâ€ paradigm of Ishai et al. We show how to instantiate this paradigm with MPC protocols in the preprocessing model; once optimized this results in an NIZKPoK with shorter proofs (and comparable computation) as in prior work for circuits containing roughly 300â€“100000 AND gates. In contrast to prior work our NIZKPoK also supports witness-independent preprocessing which allows the prover to shift most of its work to an offline phase before the witness is known. We use our NIZKPoK to construct a signature scheme based only on symmetric-key primitives (and hence with â€œpost-quantumâ€ security). The resulting scheme has shorter signatures than the scheme built using ZKB++ (and comparable signing/verification time) and is even competitive with hash-based signature schemes. To further highlight the flexibility and power of our NIZKPoK we also use it to build efficient ring and group signatures based on symmetric-key primitives alone. To our knowledge the resulting schemes are the most efficient constructions of these primitives that offer post-quantum security.,Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security,SJR - 1.026,2018,"@misc{katz_kolesnikov_wang_2018, title={Improved non-interactive zero knowledge with applications to post-quantum signatures: Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security}, url={https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243805}, journal={ACM Conferences}, publisher={Proceedings of the 2018 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security}, author={Katz, Jonathan and Kolesnikov, Vladimir and Wang, Xiao}, year={2018}, month={Oct}}"
Compact Privacy Protocols from Post-quantum and Timed Classocal Assumptions,"Jonathan Bootle, Anja Lehmann, Vadim Lyubashevsky, Gregor Seiler",While basic lattice-based primitives like encryption and digital signature schemes are already fairly short more advanced privacy-preserving protocols (e.g. group signatures) that are believed to be post-quantum secure have outputs of at least several hundred kilobytes. In this paper we propose a framework for building privacy protocols with significantly smaller parameter sizes whose secrecy is based on post-quantum assumptions but soundness additionally assumes that some classical assumption e.g. the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) is hard to break within a short amount of time.The main ingredients of our constructions are statistical zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge for certain relations whose soundness rely on the hardness of solving the discrete logarithm problem for a fresh DLP instance per proof. This notion has recently been described by the term quantum annoyance. Using such proofs while also enforcing that they be completed in a fixed amount of time we then show how to construct privacy-preserving primitives such as (dynamic) group signatures and DAA schemes where soundness is based on the hardness of the â€œtimedâ€ discrete logarithm problem and SIS.

Zero-knowledge Proof Authentication using Left Self Distributive Systems: A Post-Quantum Approach,Pedro Hecht,This paper presents a theoretical approach to zero-knowledge authentication using left self-distributive (LD) algebraic systems like Laver tables. The reason for using Laver tables is that their combinatorial properties seem quite complicated and as cited involve necessarily fast growing functions. Post-Quantum cryptography explores solutions whose security do not rely on traditional numeric fields one-way trap functions based on integer factorization or discrete logarithm problems. The paper shows at first the method after that it states as a theorem that the authentication protocol complies with a zero-knowledge proof and finally proves it. No attempt or effort has been made to develop a practical instance and the paper focus only on the theoretical aspects of the question. Despite this we sketch the potential use of Laver tables.,Congreso Iberoamericano de Seguridad Informática CIBSI (American Congress of Computer Security CIBSI),None Found,2016,"@inproceedings{hecht2015zero,

A post-quantum secure communication system for cloud manufacturing safety,Haibo Yi,In recent years as one of the new advanced manufacturing modes cloud manufacturing has been received wide attentionsaround the world. The technology of cloud manufacturing intergrades the services-oriented techniques as well as manufac-turing processes based on cloud computing. With the aid of the cloud computing platforms the manufacturing services areprovided in manufacturing clouds. However one of the key challenges of cloud manufacturing is the security and safetyof information transmission. Traditional network security architectures are based on RSA and elliptic curve cryptographicsystems which is claimed to be broken on quantum computers. We exploit the countermeasures of post-quantum algorithmsto protect cloud manufacturing against quantum computer attacks. We propose a post-quantum secure scheme for cloudmanufacturing. First in order to retain confidentiality in cloud manufacturing we propose a post-quantum asymmetric-keyencryption scheme to encrypt the message with the generated session key. Second in order to retain authentication securityin cloud manufacturing we propose a post-quantum public-key signature generation scheme. Third based on the encryptionscheme and signature generation scheme we propose a post-quantum secure communication system for cloud manufactur-ing. We implement our design on cloud-based environment and the comparison with related designs show that our design issuitable for protecting communication in cloud manufacturing.

Blockchain-Enabled Identity Verification for Safe Ridesharing Leveraging Zero-Knowledge Proof,"Wanxin Li, Collin Meese, Hao Guo, Mark Nejad",The on-demand mobility market including ridesharing is becoming increasingly important with e-hailing fares growing at a rate of approximately 130% per annum since 2013. By increasing utilization of existing vehicles and empty seats ridesharing can provide many benefits including reduced traffic congestion and environmental impact from vehicle usage and production. However the safety of riders and drivers has become of paramount concern and a method for privacy-preserving identity verification between untrusted parties is essential for protecting users. To this end we propose a novel privacy-preserving identity verification system extending zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) and blockchain for use in ridesharing applications. We design a permissioned blockchain network to perform the ZKP verification of a drivers identity which also acts as an immutable ledger to store ride logs and ZKP records. For the ZKP module we design a protocol to facilitate user verification without requiring the exchange of any private information. We prototype the proposed system on the Hyperledger Fabric platform with the Hyperledger Ursa cryptography library and conduct extensive experimentation. To measure the prototypes performance we utilize the Hyperledger Caliper benchmark tool to perform extensive analysis and the results show that our system is suitable for use in real-world ridesharing applications.,IEEE 2020 3rd International Conference on Hot Information-Centric Networking (HotICN),C,2020,"@misc{li_meese_guo_nejad, title={Blockchain-enabled identity verification for safe ridesharing leveraging zero-knowledge proof}, url={https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9350858}, journal={IEEE Xplore}, author={Li, Wanxin and Meese, Collin and Guo, Hao and Nejad, Mark}}"
Secure Digital Service Payments using Zero Knowledge Proof in Distributed Network,"M. Harikrishnan, K.V. Lakshmy",Performing a fair exchange without a Trusted Third Party (TTP) was considered to be impossible. With multi party computation and practices like Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain accomplishes a fair exchange in a trustless network. Data confidentiality is a key challenge that has to be resolved before adopting blockchain for enterprise applications where tokenized assets will be transferred. Protocols like Zcash are already providing the same for financial transactions but lacks flexibility required to apply in most of the potential use cases of blockchain. Most of the real world application work in a way where a transaction is carried out when a particular action is performed. Also the zero knowledge proof method used in Zcash ZKSNARK has certain weaknesses restricting its adoption. One of the major drawbacks of ZKSNARK is that it requires an initial trust setup phase which is difficult to achieve in blockchain ecosystem. ZKSTARK an interactive zero knowledge proof does not require this phase and also provides security against post quantum attacks. We propose a system that uses two indistinguishable hash functions along with ZKSTARK to improve the flexibility of blockchain platforms. The two indistinguishable hash functions are chosen from SHA3-finalists based on their security performance and inner designs.,IEEE 2019 5th International Conference on Advanced Computing & Communication Systems (ICACCS),B,2019,"@misc{harikrishnan_lakshmy, title={Secure Digital Service Payments Using zero knowledge proof in distributed network}, url={https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8728462}, journal={IEEE Xplore}, author={Harikrishnan, M. and Lakshmy, K.

Fault-Injection Attacks Against NIST’s Post-Quantum Cryptography Round 3 KEM Candidates,Keita Xagawa Akira Ito Rei Ueno Junko Takahashi Naofumi Homma,We investigate all NIST PQC RoundÂ 3 KEM candidates from the viewpoint of fault-injection attacks: Classic McEliece Kyber NTRU Saber BIKE FrodoKEM HQC NTRU Prime and SIKE. All KEM schemes use variants of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation so the equality test with re-encryption in decapsulation is critical.We survey effective key-recovery attacks when we can skip the equality test. We found the existing key-recovery attacks against Kyber NTRU Saber FrodoKEM HQC one of two KEM schemes in NTRU Prime and SIKE.

We also report an attack against BIKE that leads to leakage of information of secret keys.The open-source pqm4 library contains all KEM schemes except Classic McEliece and HQC. We show that giving a single instruction-skipping fault in the decapsulation processes leads to skipping the equality test virtually for Kyber NTRU Saber BIKE and SIKE.

Crystals-Dilithium on ARMv8,"Youngbeom Kim, Jingyo Song, Taek-Young Youn, and Seog Chung Seo",Crystals-Dilithium is one of the digital-signature algorithms in NISTâ€™s ongoing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization final round. Security and computational efficiency concerning software and hardware implementations are the primary criteria for PQC standardization. Many studies were conducted to efficiently apply Dilithium in various environments; however they are focused on traditionally used PC and 32-bit Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processors (Cortex-M4). ARMv8-based processors are more advanced embedded microcontrollers (MCUs) and have been widely used for various IoT devices edge computing devices and On-Board Units in autonomous driving cars. In this study we present an efficient Crystals-Dilithium implementation on ARMv8-based MCU. To enhance Dilithiumâ€™s performance we optimize number theoretic transform (NTT)-based polynomial multiplication the core operation of Dilithium by leveraging ARMv8â€™s architectural properties such as large register sets and NEON engine. We apply task parallelism to NTT-based polynomial multiplication using the NEON engine. In addition we reduced the number of memory accesses during NTT-based polynomial multiplication with the proposed merging and register-holding techniques. Finally we present an interleaved NTT-based multiplication simultaneously executed with ARM processor and NEON engine. This implementation can further optimize performance by eliminating the ARM processor latency with NEON overheads. Through the proposed optimization methods for Dilithium 3 we achieved a performance improvement of about 43.83% in key pair generation 113.25% in signing and 41.92% in verification compared to the reference implementation submitted to the final round of the NIST PQC competition.,Security and Communication Networks,SJR - 0.446,2022,"@misc{kim_song_youn_seo_2022, title={Crystals-dilithium on armv8}, url={https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2022/5226390/}, journal={Security and Communication Networks}, publisher={Hindawi}, author={Kim, Youngbeom and Song, Jingyo and Youn, Taek-Young and Seo, Seog Chung}, year={2022}, month={Feb}}"

Benchmarking Post-Quantum Cryptography in TLS,"Christian Paquin, Douglas Stebila, Goutam Tamvada",Post-quantum cryptographic primitives have a range of trade-offs compared to traditional public key algorithms either having slower computation or larger public keys and ciphertexts/signatures or both. While the performance of these algorithms in isolation is easy to measure and has been a focus of optimization techniques performance in realistic network conditions has been less studied. Google and Cloudflare have reported results from running experiments with post-quantum key exchange algorithms in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol with real usersâ€™ network traffic. Such experiments are highly realistic but cannot be replicated without access to Internet-scale infrastructure and do not allow for isolating the effect of individual network characteristics.In this work we develop and make use of a framework for running such experiments in TLS cheaply by emulating network conditions using the networking features of the Linux kernel. Our testbed allows us to independently control variables such as link latency and packet loss rate and then examine the performance impact of various post-quantum-primitives on TLS connection establishment specifically hybrid elliptic curve/post-quantum key exchange and post-quantum digital signatures based on implementations from the Open Quantum Safe project. Among our key results we observe that packet loss rates above 3â€“5% start to have a significant impact on post-quantum algorithms that fragment across many packets such as those based on unstructured lattices. The results from this emulation framework are also complemented by results on the latency of loading entire web pages over TLS in real network conditions which show that network latency hides most of the impact from algorithms with slower computations (such as supersingular isogenies).,Springer - Lecture Notes in Computer Science,SJR - 0.249,2020,"@inproceedings{paquin2020benchmarking,

NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography- A Hardwrae Evaluation Study,"Kanad Basu, Deepraj Soni, Mohammed Nabeel, Ramesh Karri",Experts forecast that quantum computers can break classical cryptographic algorithms. Scientists are developing postquantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms that are invulnerable to quantum computer attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started a public evaluation process to standardize quantum-resistant public key algorithms. The objective of our study is to provide a hardware-based comparison of the NIST PQC candidates. For this we use a High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design methodology to map high-level C specifications of round 2 PQC candidates into both FPGA and ASIC implementations.,IACR - Crypto,SJR - 0.715,2019,"@article{basu2019nist,

Instruction-Set Accelerated Implementation of CRYSTALS-Kyber,"Mojtaba Bisheh-Niasar, Reza Azarderakhsh, Mehran Mozaffari-Kermani",Large scale quantum computers will break classical public-key cryptography protocols by quantum algorithms such as Shorâ€™s algorithm. Hence designing quantum-safe cryptosystems to replace current classical algorithms is crucial. Luckily there are some post-quantum candidates that are assumed to be resistant against future attacks from quantum computers and NIST is considering standardizing them. Among these candidates lattice-based cryptography sounds more interesting than others due to the performance results as well as confidence in the security. There are few works in the literature evaluating the performance of lattice-based cryptography in hardware. In this paper we focus on Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices (CRYSTALS) key exchange mechanisms known as Kyber and provide an instruction-set hardware architecture and implement on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA for performance evaluation and testing. Our proposed architecture provides an efficient and high-performance set of components to perform polynomial sampling number-theoretic transform (NTT) and point-wise multiplication to speed up lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This architecture implemented on ASIC outperforms state-of-the-art implementations.,IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers,A,2021,"@misc{bisheh-niasar_azarderakhsh_mozaffari-kermani, title={Instruction-set accelerated implementation of crystals-kyber}, url={https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9525069}, journal={IEEE Xplore}, author={Bisheh-Niasar, Mojtaba and Azarderakhsh, Reza and Mozaffari-Kermani, Mehran}}"
Zero-Knowledge Reparation of the Véron and AGS Code-based Identification Schemes,"Slim Bettaieb, Loïc Bidoux, Olivier Blazy, Philippe Gaborit",Designing code-based signatures is both an important and challenging problem. A standard way to tackle it consists to use the Fiat-Shamir heuristic along with an identification scheme that is required to be zero-knowledge. The authors of [1] have highlighted an issue within the zero-knowledge proof of the Veron identification scheme [2]. It turns out that the zero-knowledge proof of the AGS protocol [3] is impacted in a similar way. In this paper we present a masking technique that solves the aforementioned issue without inducing any performance penalty. We introduce the Masked Veron and Masked AGS protocols that both leverage this masking technique and provide their zero-knowledge proofs. In addition we present a new technique improving the performances of signatures built from code-based identification schemes subject to the attack described in [4]. The Masked Veron and Masked AGS protocols feature all the existing performance improvements from the literature.,IEEE ISIT,B,2021,"@misc{bettaieb_bidoux_blazy_gaborit, title={Zero-knowledge reparation of the Véron and AGS code-based identification schemes}, url={https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9517937}, journal={IEEE Xplore}, author={Bettaieb, Slim and Bidoux, Loïc and Blazy, Olivier and Gaborit, Philippe}}"
Efficient Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems,"Jonathan Bootle, Andrea Cerulli, Pyrros Chaidos, Jens Groth",A proof system can be used by a prover to demonstrate to one or more verifiers that a statement is true. Proof systems can be interactive where the prover and verifier exchange many messages or non-interactive where the prover sends a single convincing proof to the verifier. Proof systems are widely used in cryptographic protocols to verify that a party is following a protocol correctly and is not cheating.A particular type of proof systems are zero-knowledge proof systems where the prover convinces the verifier that the statement is true but does not leak any other information. Zero-knowledge proofs are useful when the prover has private data that should not be leaked but needs to demonstrate a certain fact about this data. The prover may for instance want to show it is following a protocol correctly but not want to reveal its own input.In these lecture notes we give an overview of some central techniques behind the construction of efficient zero-knowledge proofs.,Lecture Notes in Computer Science - springer,SJR - 0.339,2016,"@misc{bootle_cerulli_chaidos_groth_1970, title={Efficient zero-knowledge proof systems}, url={https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-43005-8_1}, journal={SpringerLink}, publisher={Springer International Publishing}, author={Bootle, Jonathan and Cerulli, Andrea and Chaidos, Pyrros and Groth, Jens}, year={1970}, month={Jan}}"

Mamoun Alazab",Upgradation of technologies for sustainable smart cities has led to rapid growth in Internet of Things (IoT) applications including e-healthcare services wherein smart devices collect patient data and deliver it remotely to the servers in real-time. Despite its enormous benefits IoT in healthcare has not received much attention primarily due to the risk of unauthorized access to confidential medical information enabled by the vulnerable wireless channel for communication. Besides tiny IoT devices have limited computing power and storage capabilities that prevent administrators from using complex and resource-hungry security protocols. The cyber attacks on the Internet of Healthcare applications (IoHA) could result in fatalities decreased revenue and reputation loss hence endangering sustainability. The existing security protocols are unsuitable due to the cost complexities that necessitate developing new security protocols for resource-constrained and heterogeneous IoT networks. We introduce a confidentiality and anonymity-preserving scheme for critical infrastructures of IoT to conquer cyber threats for sustainable healthcare. This paper proposes Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) based Authenticated Key Agreement (AKA) protocol for IoHA. ZKP-AKA uses zero-knowledge proofs physically unclonable function biometrics symmetric cryptography message digest etc. for accomplishing the protocolâ€™s objective at minimal computation storage and communication expenses. ZKP-AKA retains data integrity confidentiality anonymity and safety from significant cyber threats.,Sustainable Cities and Society - Elsevier,SJR - 1.645,2022,"@misc{gaba_hedabou_kumar_braeken_liyanage_alazab_2022, title={Zero knowledge proofs based authenticated key agreement protocol for sustainable healthcare}, url={https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670722000956}, journal={Sustainable Cities and Society}, publisher={Elsevier}, author={Gaba, Gurjot Singh and Hedabou, Mustapha and Kumar, Pardeep and Braeken, An and Liyanage, Madhusanka and Alazab, Mamoun}, year={2022}, month={Feb}}"

Lightweight zero knowledge authentication for Internet of things,"Alican Beydemir,, Ibrahim Sogukpinar",Importance of Internet of Things technologies increased in recent years. However these technologies carry some security vulnerabilities because of their network communication layer. The root cause of these vulnerabilities is usually the Authentication problem.

An Efficient Non-Profiled Side-Channel Attack on the CRYSTALS-Dilithium Post-Quantum Signature,"Zhaohui Chen, Emre Karabulut, Aydin Aysu, Yuan Ma, Jiwu Jing",Post-quantum digital signature is a critical primitive of computer security in the era of quantum hegemony. As a finalist of the post-quantum cryptography standardization process the theoretical security of the CRYSTALS-Dilithium (Dilithium) signature scheme has been quantified to withstand classical and quantum cryptanalysis. However there is an inherent power side-channel information leakage in its implementation instance due to the physical characteristics of hardware.This work proposes an efficient non-profiled Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) strategy on Dilithium to recover the secret key by targeting the underlying polynomial multiplication arithmetic. We first develop a conservative scheme with a reduced key guess space which can extract a secret key coefficient with a 99.99% confidence using 157 power traces of the reference Dilithium implementation. However this scheme suffers from the computational overhead caused by the large modulus in Dilithium signature. To further accelerate the CPA run-time we propose a fast two-stage scheme that selects a smaller search space and then resolves false positives. We finally construct a hybrid scheme that combines the advantages of both schemes. Real-world experiment on the power measurement data shows that our hybrid scheme improves the attackâ€™s execution time by 7.77Ã—.,IEEE 39th International Conference on Computer Design,SJR - 0.102,2021,"@inproceedings{chen2021efficient,

Post-quantum cryptography,Daniel J. Bernstein & Tanja Lange,Cryptography is essential for the security of online communication cars and implanted medical devices. However many commonly used cryptosystems will be completely broken once large quantum computers exist. Post-quantum cryptography is cryptography under the assumption that the attacker has a large quantum computer; post-quantum cryptosystems strive to remain secure even in this scenario. This relatively young research area has seen some successes in identifying mathematical operations for which quantum algorithms offer little advantage in speed and then building cryptographic systems around those.

CRYSTALS-Kyber: a CCA-secure module-lattice-based KEM,"Joppe Bos, Leo Ducas, Eike Kiltz, Tancrede Lepoint, Vadim Lyubashevsky, John M. Schanck, Peter Schwabe, Gregor Seiler, Damien Stehle",Abstractâ€”Rapid advances in quantum computing together with the announcement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to define new standards for digitalsignature encryption and key establishment protocols have created significant interest in post-quantum cryptographic schemes. This paper introduces Kyber (part of CRYSTALS â€“ Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices â€“ a package submitted to NIST post-quantum standardization effort in November 2017) a portfolio of post-quantum cryptographic primitives built around a key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on hardness assumptions over module lattices. Our KEM is most naturally seen as a successor to the NEWHOPE KEM (Usenix 2016). In particular the key and ciphertext sizes of our new construction are about half the size the KEM offers CCA instead of only passive security the security is based on a more general (and flexible) lattice problem and our optimized implementation results in essentially the same running time as the aforementioned scheme. We first introduce a CPA-secure public-key encryption scheme apply a variant of the Fujisakiâ€“Okamoto transform to create a CCA-secure KEM and eventually construct in a black-box manner CCA-secure encryption key exchange and authenticated-key-exchange schemes. The security of our primitives is based on the hardness of Module-LWE in the classical and quantum random oracle models and our concrete parameters conservatively target more than 128 bits of postquantum security.,IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy,"SJR - None available, H-index - 11",2018,"@inproceedings{bos2018crystals,

High-performance area-efficient polynomial ring processor for CRYSTALS-Kyber on FPGAs,"Zhaohui Chen, Yuan Ma, Tianyu Chen, Jingqiang Lin, Jiwu Jing",The quantum-resistant attribute is a new design criterion for cryptography algorithms in the era of quantum supremacy. Lattice-based cryptography is proved to be secure against quantum computing. CRYSTALS-Kyber is a lattice-based promising candidate in the post-quantum cryptography standardization process. This paper proposes a high-performance polynomial ring processor for the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm. The processor executes optimized polynomial ring arithmetic which cuts off over 20%/50% on the times of modular multiplication/addition compared with the straightforward implementations. Besides the forward and inverse Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) reuse the control logic with the help of an efficient configurable butterfly unit to minimize the area of the finite state machine. Further the underlying dual-column sequential storage scheme breaks the bottleneck of memory accessing. To evaluate the performance a fully pipelined architecture is implemented on a low-cost FPGA platform. Benefiting from these optimizations the Kyber1024 processor can perform NTT operation for a 4-dimensional polynomial vector in 17.1 Î¼s and it achieves speedup by a factor of 2.1 compared with the state-of-the-art implementation.,"Integration, the VLSI Journal",SJR - 0.264,2021,"@article{chen2021high,

A zero-knowledge-proof-based digital identity management scheme in blockchain,"Ziaohui Yang, Wenjie Li",The traditional centralized digital identity management system (DIMS) has been subject to threats such as fragmented identity single point of failure internal attacks and privacy leakage. Emerging blockchain technology allows DIMSs to be deployed in it which largely alleviates the problems caused by the centralized third party but its inherent transparency and lack of privacy pose a huge challenge to DIMSs. In this regard we leverage the smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) algorithms to improve the existing claim identity model in blockchain to realize the identity unlinkability effectively avoiding the exposure of the ownership of attributes. Furthermore we implement a system prototype named BZDIMS that includes a challenge-response protocol which allows users to selectively disclose their ownership of attributes to service providers to protect usersâ€™ behavior privacy. Performance evaluation and security analysis show that our scheme achieves effective attribute privacy protection and a wider application scope compared with the prior model.,Scence Direct,N/A,2020,"@article{YANG2020102050, title = {A zero-knowledge-proof-based digital identity management scheme in blockchain}, journal = {Computers & Security}, volume = {99}, pages = {102050}, year = {2020}, issn = {0167-4048}, doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2020.102050}, url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404820303230}, author = {Xiaohui Yang and Wenjie Li}, keywords = {Blockchain, Zero-knowledge proof, Smart contract, Digital identity, Privacy protection},"
Privacy-Preserving Traffic Management: A Blockchain and Zero-Knowledge Proof Inspired Approach,"Wanxin Li, Hao Guo, Mark Nejad, Chien-Chung Shen",Incorporation of connected vehicle (CV) data into real-time traffic management systems presents a host of new challenges resulting from the current lack of data integrity and data privacy in traffic networks. Over the past few years blockchain technologies have been inspiring extensive innovations in the transportation field. However due to the transparency property sensitive data stored on the blockchain would be accessible to anyone resulting in a lack of privacy. In this paper we propose a decentralized and location-aware architecture to address the data integrity along with the privacy-preserving issues in blockchain-based traffic management systems. Our proposed architecture integrates with permissioned and modular blockchain network and non-interactive zero-knowledge range proof (ZKRP) protocol.

Towards CRYSTALS-Kyber: A M-LWE Cryptoprocessor with Area-Time Trade-Off,Kan Yao; Dur-E-Shahwar Kundi; Chenghua Wang; Maire O’Neill; Weiqiang Liu,CRYSTALS-Kyber is a quantum-resistant and promising lattice-based cryptography (LBC) in the finalists of the third round post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization which is based on the hardness of Module-Learning with Errors (M-LWE). The variadic parameters make M-LWE obtain a more flexible security-performance trade-off than Ring-LWE. In this paper we propose a M-LWE cryptoprocessor targeting CRYSTALS-Kyber with area-time trade-off for the first time. This balanced design includes a fast and low-cost Binomial Sampler and vector-polynomials multiplication structure based on pipelined decimation-in-frequency (DIF) based Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) technique. The M-LWE cryptoprocessor achieve 27708 encryption operations per second using only 690 slices and 106716 decryption operations per second using only 571 slices. Our proposed design achieved the lowest area-time product (ATP) with at least 2 Ï‡ performance improvement than the state-of-the-art LBC designs with a similar security level and complexity of polynomials.,2021 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS),N/a,2021,"@INPROCEEDINGS{9401253,

A Software/Hardware Co-Design of Crystals-Dilithium Signature Scheme,"Zhen Zhou, Debiao He, Zhe Liu, Min Luo, Kim-Kwang Raymond Choo",As quantum computers become more affordable and commonplace existing security systems that are based on classical cryptographic primitives such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) will no longer be secure. Hence there has been interest in designing post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes such as those based on lattice-based cryptography (LBC). The potential of LBC schemes is evidenced by the number of such schemes passing the selection of NIST PQC Standardization Process Round-3. One such scheme is the Crystals-Dilithium signature scheme which is based on the hard module-lattice problem. However there is no efficient implementation of the Crystals-Dilithium signature scheme. Hence in this article we present a compact hardware architecture containing elaborate modular multiplication units using the Karatsuba algorithm along with smart generators of address sequence and twiddle factors for NTT which can complete polynomial addition/multiplication with the parameter setting of Dilithium in a short clock period. Also we propose a fast software/hardware co-design implementation on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for the Dilithium scheme with a tradeoff between speed and resource utilization. Our co-design implementation outperforms a pure C implementation on a Nios-II processor of the platform Altera DE2-115 in the sense that our implementation is 11.2 and 7.4 times faster for signature and verification respectively. In addition we also achieve approximately 51% and 31% speed improvement for signature and verification in comparison to the pure C implementation on processor ARM Cortex-A9 of ZYNQ-7020 platform.,ACM transactions on reconfigurable technology and systems,N/A,2021,"@article{10.1145/3447812,

Side-Channel Analysis of CRYSTALS-Kyber and A Novel Low-Cost Countermeasure,"Meziane Hamoudi, Amina Bel Korchi, Sylvain Guilley, Sofiane Takarabt, Khaled Karray & Youssef Souissi",In this paper we propose a vertical side-channel leakage detection on the decryption function of the third round implementation of CPA-secure public-key encryption scheme underlying CRYSTALS-Kyber a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism which is a candidate to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project. Using a leakage assessment metric we show that the side-channel information can be efficiently used to pinpoint operations leaking the secret variable and how masking countermeasures can be applied. We detect leakages in the polynomial multiplication between the secret key and the ciphertext. We propose and evaluate two different masking countermeasures based on additive and multiplicative masking. To the best of our knowledge the multiplicative masking has not been proposed before as a countermeasure to CRYSTALS-Kyber vulnerabilities. We demonstrate their efficiency and discuss their impact in terms of performance. Our work is beneficial to assess and enhance the security of Post-Quantum Cryptography against advanced vertical side-channel analysis.,Communications in Computer and Information Science,B,2021,"@misc{hamoudi_bel korchi_guilley_takarabt_karray_souissi_1970, title={Side-channel analysis of&nbsp;crystals-kyber and a novel low-cost countermeasure}, url={https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-90553-8_3#chapter-info}, journal={SpringerLink}, publisher={Springer International Publishing}, author={Hamoudi, Meziane and Bel Korchi, Amina and Guilley, Sylvain and Takarabt, Sofiane and Karray, Khaled and Souissi, Youssef}, year={1970}, month={Jan}}"

A Compact and High-Performance Hardware Architecture for CRYSTALS-Dilithium,"Cankun Zhao, Neng Zhang, Hanning Wang, Bohan Yang, Wenping Zhu, Zhengdong Li, Min Zhu, Shouyi Yin, Shaojun Wei, Leibo Liu",The lattice-based CRYSTALS-Dilithium scheme is one of the three third-round digital signature finalists in the National Institute of Standards and TechnologyPost-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process.

Extending Web Applications with a Lightweight Zero Knowledge Proof Authentication,"Sławomir Grzonkowski, Wojciech Zaremba, Maciej Zaremba, Bill McDaniel",The notion of zero-knowledge [20] is formalized by requiring that for every malicious efficient verifier V * there exists an efficient simulator S that can reconstruct the view of V * in a true interaction with the prover in a way that is indistinguishable to every polynomial-time distinguisher. Weak zero-knowledge weakens this notions by switching the order of the quantifiers and only requires that for every distinguisher D there exists a (potentially different) simulator S D .In this paper we consider various notions of zero-knowledge and investigate whether their weak variants are equivalent to their strong variants. Although we show (under complexity assumption) that for the standard notion of zero-knowledge its weak and strong counterparts are not equivalent for meaningful variants of the standard notion the weak and strong counterparts are indeed equivalent. Towards showing these equivalences we introduce new non-black-box simulation techniques permitting us for instance to demonstrate that the classical 2-round graph non-isomorphism protocol of Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson [18] satisfies a â€œdistributionalâ€ variant of zero-knowledge.Our equivalence theorem has other applications beyond the notion of zero-knowledge. For instance it directly implies the dense model theorem of Reingold et al (STOC â€™08) and the leakage lemma of Gentry-Wichs (STOC â€™11) and provides a modular and arguably simpler proof of these results (while at the same time recasting these result in the language of zero-knowledge).,CSTST,A,2008,"@inproceedings{10.1145/1456223.1456241,

A Review of Post-quantum Cryptography and Crypto-agility Strategies,Olaf Grote; Andreas Ahrens; César Benavente-Peces,Our transaction history in the current centralized banking system has the ability to reveal a lot of private information for each spender both to the banking system itself but also to those entities that surround it (e.g. governments industry etc). Examples of leaking information constitute the amounts spent the goods on which the amounts were spent the spending locations and the users we exchange money with. This knowledge is powerful in the hands of those who have it and can be used in multiple ways not always to our benefit. Cryptocurrencies such as the famous Bitcoin were proposed as a means to address the limitations of centralized banking systems and to offer its users privacy with regards to their transactional data. In this work we perform a systematic literature review on the realm of privacy for electronic currencies. We present the development of digital money from electronic cash to cryptocurrencies and focus on the techniques that are employed to enhance user-privacy. Furthermore we present flaws of the current cryptocurrency systems which reduce the privacy of the cryptocurrency users. Finally we describe three research directions to enhance privacy for cryptocurrencies: transaction propagation mechanisms succinct ZK proof systems without a trusted setup and specialised trustless zero-knowledge proofs.,2019 International Interdisciplinary PhD Workshop (IIPhDW),N/A,2019,"@INPROCEEDINGS{8755433,

"A Hardware Evaluation Study of NIST
Post-Quantum Cryptographic Signature schemes","Deepraj Soni, Kanad Basu, Mohammed Nabeel, Ramesh Karri",Rapid advances in quantum computing together with the announcement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to define new standards for digitalsignature encryption and key-establishment protocols have created significant interest in post-quantum cryptographic schemes. This paper introduces Kyber (part of CRYSTALS - Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices - a package submitted to NIST post-quantum standardization effort in November 2017) a portfolio of post-quantum cryptographic primitives built around a key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on hardness assumptions over module lattices. Our KEM is most naturally seen as a successor to the NEWHOPE KEM (Usenix 2016). In particular the key and ciphertext sizes of our new construction are about half the size the KEM offers CCA instead of only passive security the security is based on a more general (and flexible) lattice problem and our optimized implementation results in essentially the same running time as the aforementioned scheme. We first introduce a CPA-secure public-key encryption scheme apply a variant of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform to create a CCA-secure KEM and eventually construct in a black-box manner CCA-secure encryption key exchange and authenticated-key-exchange schemes. The security of our primitives is based on the hardness of Module-LWE in the classical and quantum random oracle models and our concrete parameters conservatively target more than 128 bits of postquantum security.,NIST,A*,2019,"@misc{a hardware evaluation study of nist post-quantum ... - csrc, url={https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Events/Second-PQC-Standardization-Conference/documents/accepted-papers/soni-hardware-evaluation.pdf}}"

An authentication protocol based on chaos and zero knowledge proof,"Will Major, William J. Buchanan, Jawad Ahmad",Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic protocols which do not disclose the information or secret itself during the protocol. Zero-knowledge proofs plays an important role in the design of cryptographic protocols. The application of Zero-knowledge protocols can be in authentication identification key exchange and other basic cryptographic operations. Zero-knowledge proof has been implemented without expose any secret information during the conversation and with smaller computational requirement than using comparable public key protocols. The most cryptographic problems can be solved with the help of zero-knowledge protocols as well as with cryptography. Zeroknowledge protocols can be a best solution in many occasions. The Zero-knowledge proof protocols are very lightweight due to which it requires less amount of memory. Thus Zero-knowledge protocols widely used especially in authentication.

Limbo: Efficient Zero-knowledge MPCitH-based Arguments,"Cyrien Delpech de Saint Guilhem, Emmanuela Orsini, Titouan Tanguy",Port Knocking is a method for authenticating clients through a closed stance firewall and authorising their requested actions enabling severs to offer services to authenticated clients without opening ports on the firewall. Advances in port knocking have resulted in an increase in complexity in design preventing port knocking solutions from realising their potential. This paper proposes a novel port knocking solution named Crucible which is a secure method of authentication with high usability and features of stealth allowing servers and services to remain hidden and protected. Crucible is a stateless solution only requiring the client memorise a command the serverâ€™s IP and a chosen password. The solution is forwarded as a method for protecting servers against attacks ranging from port scans to zero-day exploitation.

A survey on NIST PQ signatures,"Nicola Di Chiano, Riccardo Longo, Alessio Meneghetti, and Giordano Santilli",This work introduces a new interactive oracle proof system based on the MPC-in-theHead paradigm. To improve concrete efficiency and offer flexibility between computation time and communication size a generic proof construction based on multi-round MPC protocols is proposed instantiated with a specific protocol and implemented and compared to similar proof systems. Performance gains over previous work derive from a multi-party multiplication check optimized for the multi-round and MPC-in-the-Head settings. Of most interest among implementation optimizations is the use of identical randomness across repeated MPC protocol executions in order to accelerate computation without excessive cost to the soundness error.The new system creates proofs of SHA-256 pre-images of 43KB in 53ms with 16 MPC parties or 23KB in 188ms for 128 parties. As a signature scheme the non-interactive variant produces signatures based on the AES-128 circuit of 18KB in about 4ms; this is 20% faster and 32 % larger than the Picnic3 scheme (13kB in 5.3ms for 16 parties) which is based on the 90% smaller LowMC circuit.,ArXiv,N/A - not found on any of the sources,2021,"@article{di2021survey,

Towards Post-Quantum Blockchain: A Review on Blockchain Cryptography Resistant to Quantum Computing Attacks,Tiago M. Fernández-Caramès; Paula Fraga-Lamas,Shorâ€™s shockingly fast quantum algorithm for solving the period-finding problem is a threat for the most common public-key primitives as it can be efficiently applied to solve both the Integer Factorisation Problem and the Discrete Logarithm Problem. In other words as soon as a large-enough quantum computer is born many once-secure protocols have to be replaced by still-secure alternatives. Instead of relying for example on the RSA protocol the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange or the (Elliptic Curve) Digital Signature Algorithm many researchers moved their attention to the design and analysis of primitives which are yet to be broken by quantum algorithms.The urgency of the threat imposed by quantum computers led the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to open calls for both Post-Quantum Public-Keys Exchange Algorithms and Post-Quantum Digital Signature Algorithms [32]. This new NIST standardisation process started in 2016 has involved hundreds of researchers has seen 37 early submissions for a total of 82 proposals and has recently reached its third round of analyses.In this brief survey we focus on the round 3 finalists and alternate candidates for Digital Signatures announced on July 22 2020:These schemes are designed to address distinct security levels known as Security LevelI III and V. These levels correspond to respectively 128 192 and 256 bits of security against collisions. Among the six schemes above only Falcon cannot be instantiated to all three security levels. In order to present these primitives we start in Section 1 with an introduction to their underlying mathematical objects and the related problems i.e. lattices polynomial ideals one-way functions and zero-knowledge proofs. Then Section 2 describes the six digital signatures and lists their algorithms for key-generation signing and verification. Finally in Section 3 we conclude with a comparison between the different schemes.,IEEE Access,B,2020,"""@ARTICLE{8967098,  author={Fernndez-Carams, Tiago M. and Fraga-Lamas, Paula},  journal={IEEE Access},   title={Towards Post-Quantum Blockchain: A Review on Blockchain Cryptography Resistant to Quantum Computing Attacks},   year={2020},  volume={8},  number={},  pages={21091-21116},  doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2968985}}"""
Variations of QKD Protocols Based on Conventional System Measurements: A Literature Review,Abdulbast A. Abushgra,Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have evolved significantly in the last years and their use has been suggested for numerous applications due to their ability to provide transparency redundancy and accountability. In the case of blockchain such characteristics are provided through public-key cryptography and hash functions. However the fast progress of quantum computing has opened the possibility of performing attacks based on Grovers and Shors algorithms in the near future. Such algorithms threaten both public-key cryptography and hash functions forcing to redesign blockchains to make use of cryptosystems that withstand quantum attacks thus creating which are known as post-quantum quantum-proof quantum-safe or quantum-resistant cryptosystems. For such a purpose this article first studies current state of the art on post-quantum cryptosystems and how they can be applied to blockchains and DLTs. Moreover the most relevant post-quantum blockchain systems are studied as well as their main challenges. Furthermore extensive comparisons are provided on the characteristics and performance of the most promising post-quantum public-key encryption and digital signature schemes for blockchains. Thus this article seeks to provide a broad view and useful guidelines on post-quantum blockchain security to future blockchain researchers and developers.,Cryptography; Basel,N/A,2022,"""@article{author={Abushgra,Abdulbast A.},year={2022},title={Variations of QKD Protocols Based on Conventional System Measurements: A Literature Review},journal={Cryptography},volume={6},number={1},pages={12},note={Copyright -  2022 by the author.

abstract=""Fiat-Shamir with aborts is a technique to transform a lattice-based identification scheme to a signature scheme introduced by Lyubashevsky (in Asiacrypt 2009). The scheme is also provably secure based on some standard lattice problems. In this paper, we show how to generically transform a signature scheme, obtained by Fiat-Shamir transformation from the ring learning with errors problem (RLWE), to a ring signature. The ring signature obtained with this transformation possesses standard security notions like unforgeability and anonymity. We also show how to achieve a linkable ring signature from the ring signature using a collision-resistant hash function.

The Fiat-Shamir Zoo: Relating the Security of Different Signature Variants,"Matilda Backendal, Mihir Bellare, Jessica Sorrell & Jiahao Sun ",Fiat-Shamir with aborts is a technique to transform a latticebased identification scheme to a signature scheme introduced by Lyubashevsky (in Asiacrypt 2009). The scheme is also provably secure based on some standard lattice problems. In this paper we show how to generically transform a signature scheme obtained by Fiat-Shamir transformation from the ring learning with errors problem (RLWE) to a ring signature. The ring signature obtained with this transformation possesses standard security notions like unforgeability and anonymity. We also show how to achieve a linkable ring signature from the ring signature using a collisionresistant hash function. Linkable ring signatures are an important cryptographic tool as it protects signer anonymity and link signatures from the same signer. The linkable ring signature obtained from this transformation performs at par with the other lattice-based solutions for linkable ring signature which does not require high-end zero-knowledge proofs.,NordSec 2018: Secure IT Systems,N/A,2018,"@InProceedings{10.1007/978-3-030-03638-6_10,

abstract=""The Fiat-Shamir paradigm encompasses many different ways of turning a given identification scheme into a signature scheme. Security proofs pertain sometimes to one variant, sometimes to another. We systematically study three variants that we call the challenge (signature is challenge and response), commit (signature is commitment and response), and transcript (signature is challenge, commitment and response) variants. Our framework captures the variants via transforms that determine the signature scheme as a function of not only the identification scheme and hash function (to cover both standard and random oracle model hashing), but also what we call a signing algorithm, to cover both classical and with-abort signing. We relate the security of the signature schemes produced by these transforms, giving minimal conditions under which uf-security of one transfers to the other. To apply this comprehensively, we formalize linear identification schemes, show that many schemes in the literature are linear, and show that any linear scheme meets our conditions for the signature schemes given by the three transforms to have equivalent uf-security. Our results give a comprehensive picture of the Fiat-Shamir zoo and allow proofs of security in the literature to be transferred automatically from one variant to another."",
