The NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process began in 2017 with 69 candidate algorithms that met both the minimum acceptance criteria and submission requirements. The first round lasted until January 2019 during which candidate algorithms were evaluated based on their security performance and other characteristics. NIST selected 26 algorithms to advance to the second round for more analysis. This report describes the evaluation and selection process based on public feedback and internal review of the second-round candidates. The report summarizes the 26 second-round candidate algorithms and identifies those selected to move forward to the third round of the competition. The third-round finalist public-key encryption and key-establishment algorithms are Classic McEliece CRYSTALS-KYBER NTRU and SABER. The third-round finalists for digital signatures are CRYSTALS-DILITHIUM FALCON and Rainbow. These finalists will be considered for standardization at the end of the third round. In addition eight alternate candidate algorithms will also advance to the third round: BIKE FrodoKEM HQC NTRU Prime SIKE GeMSS Picnic and SPHINCS+. These additional candidates are still being considered for standardization although this is unlikely to occur at the end of the third round. NIST hopes that the announcement of these finalists and additional candidates will serve to focus the cryptographic community’s attention during the next round,2020
The notion of zero-knowledge [20] is formalized by requiring that for every malicious efficient verifier V * there exists an efficient simulator S that can reconstruct the view of V * in a true interaction with the prover in a way that is indistinguishable to every polynomial-time distinguisher. Weak zero-knowledge weakens this notions by switching the order of the quantifiers and only requires that for every distinguisher D there exists a (potentially different) simulator S D .In this paper we consider various notions of zero-knowledge and investigate whether their weak variants are equivalent to their strong variants. Although we show (under complexity assumption) that for the standard notion of zero-knowledge its weak and strong counterparts are not equivalent for meaningful variants of the standard notion the weak and strong counterparts are indeed equivalent. Towards showing these equivalences we introduce new non-black-box simulation techniques permitting us for instance to demonstrate that the classical 2-round graph non-isomorphism protocol of Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson [18] satisfies a “distributional” variant of zero-knowledge.Our equivalence theorem has other applications beyond the notion of zero-knowledge. For instance it directly implies the dense model theorem of Reingold et al (STOC ’08) and the leakage lemma of Gentry-Wichs (STOC ’11) and provides a modular and arguably simpler proof of these results (while at the same time recasting these result in the language of zero-knowledge).,2015
In this paper we address the construction of privacy-friendly cryptographic primitives for the post-quantum era and in particular accumulators with zero-knowledge membership proofs and ring signatures. This is an important topic as it helps to protect the privacy of users in online authentication or emerging technologies such as cryptocurrencies. Recently we have seen first such constructions mostly based on assumptions related to codes and lattices. We however ask whether it is possible to construct such primitives without relying on structured hardness assumptions but solely based on symmetric-key primitives such as hash functions or block ciphers. This is interesting because the resistance of latter primitives to quantum attacks is quite well understood.In doing so we choose a modular approach and firstly construct an accumulator (with one-way domain) that allows to efficiently prove knowledge of (a pre-image of) an accumulated value in zero-knowledge. We thereby take care that our construction can be instantiated solely from symmetric-key primitives and that our proofs are of sublinear size. Latter is non trivial to achieve in the symmetric setting due to the absence of algebraic structures which are typically used in other settings to make these efficiency gains. Regarding efficient instantiations of our proof system we rely on recent results for constructing efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs for general circuits. Based on this building block we then show how to construct logarithmic size ring signatures solely from symmetric-key primitives. As constructing more advanced primitives only from symmetric-key primitives is a very recent field we discuss some interesting open problems and future research directions. Finally we want to stress that our work also indirectly impacts other fields: for the first time it raises the requirement for collision resistant hash functions with particularly low AND count.,2018
In last years there has been an increasing effort to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT) including blockchain. One of the main topics of interest given its importance is the research and development of privacy mechanisms as for example is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP) as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed) Advances in cryptology—EUROCRYPT 2000 Springer Berlin 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in: Josef (ed) Advances in cryptology—ASIACRYPT 2008 Springer Berlin 2008) and bulletproofs (Bünz et al. in: 2018 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP) 2018) proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since bulletproofs (Bünz et al. 2018) is the most efficient construction we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous schemes but also avoids the trusted setup which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies if the setup phase is compromised it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic ZKP in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements and thus it is not only restricted to ZKRP but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Also we present our implementation which was open sourced (Morais et al. in: Zero knowledge range proof implementation 2018. https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof).,2019
Blockchain which is usually regarded as a public decentralized and distributed ledger has attracted significant attention recently. In the environment of blockchain all historical transaction data are recorded and stored. However because blockchain is open and transparent a malicious user may illegally access private transaction data including transaction amount account address and account balance. As a cryptographic technique zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) can be used to verify whether the prover has enough transaction amount in the environment of blockchain without leaking any private transaction data. This article provides a comprehensive survey on ZKP in the environment of blockchain with the aim of highlighting security problems and challenges. It first discusses the framework models and applications of ZKP. Next it provides an introduction of blockchain and proposes a framework of ZKP in the environment of blockchain. Then it highlights the current state of ZKP in the environment of blockchain. Finally it identifies some potential problems and future research directions.,2021
In recent years there has been a substantial amount of research on quantum computers – machines that exploit quantum mechanical phenomena to solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for conventional computers. If large-scale quantum computers are ever built they will be able to break many of the public-key cryptosystems currently in use. This would seriously compromise the confidentiality and integrity of digital communications on the Internet and elsewhere. The goal of post-quantum cryptography (also called quantum-resistant cryptography) is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks. This Internal Report shares the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)’s current understanding about the status of quantum computing and post-quantum cryptography and outlines NIST’s initial plan to move forward in this space. The report also recognizes the challenge of moving to new cryptographic infrastructures and therefore emphasizes the need for agencies to focus on crypto agility.,2016
Zero-knowledge proof system is an important protocol that can be usedas a basic block for construction of other more complex cryptographic protocols. Anintrinsic characteristic of a zero-knowledge systems is the assumption that is impossible for the verifier to show to a third party that he has interacted with the prover.However it has been shown that using quantum correlations the impossibility of transferring proofs can be successfully attacked. In this work we show two new protocolsfor proof transference being the first one based on teleportation and the second onewithout using entangled states. In this last case we assume that the third party can communicate in advance with both verifier and prover. Following we present a quantumzero-knowledge protocol based on quantum bit commitment that can be implementedwith today technology.,2009
Port Knocking is a method for authenticating clients through a closed stance firewall and authorising their requested actions enabling severs to offer services to authenticated clients without opening ports on the firewall. Advances in port knocking have resulted in an increase in complexity in design preventing port knocking solutions from realising their potential. This paper proposes a novel port knocking solution named Crucible which is a secure method of authentication with high usability and features of stealth allowing servers and services to remain hidden and protected. Crucible is a stateless solution only requiring the client memorise a command the server’s IP and a chosen password. The solution is forwarded as a method for protecting servers against attacks ranging from port scans to zero-day exploitation. To act as a random oracle for both client and server cryptographic hashes were generated through chaotic systems.,2020
This paper describes the design and analysis of a new scheme for the authenticatedexchange of confidential information in insecure environments within the Internet of Things whichallows a receiver of a message to authenticate the sender and compute a secret key shared with it.The proposal is based on the concept of a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof so that in a singlecommunication relevant data may be inferred to verify the legitimacy of the sender. Besides the newscheme uses the idea under the Diffie–Hellman protocol for the establishment of a shared secret key.The proposal has been fully developed for platforms built on the Android Open Source Project so itcan be used in any device or sensor with this operating system. This work provides a performancestudy of the implementation and a comparison between its promising results and others obtainedwith similar schemes.,2016
"As one of the most important trusted third-party-based authentication protocols Kerberos is widely used to provide authentication service in distributed networks. However it is vulnerable to common brute force password-guessing attacks because of its password-based mechanism. Some enhanced Kerberos protocols based on public key cryptography were proposed as solutions but they require excessive computation and communication resources. In this paper a new enhanced Kerberos protocol with non-interactive zero-knowledge proof is proposed in which the clients and the authentication server can mutually authenticate each other without revealing any information during the authentication process. Our security analysis and experimental results have shown that the proposed scheme can resist password-guessing attacks and is more convenient and efficient than previous schemes. ",2015
CYBER SECURITY DEALS with the protection of computer systems from attacks that could compromise the hardware software or information. These attacks by allowing unauthorized use could leak private information and cause damage or disruption. In the future the part of everyday life and economy requiring computer systems is bound to increase further and become fully dominant. Cyber warfare and cyber crime will be common and the role of cyber security crucial. SINCE THE COMPUTER systems (and attackers) evolve both in hardware and software the constant evolution of this field is of high importance. Arguably the most dramatic development that one can envision is a change in the paradigm of computational model used. Quantum technologies appear to bring us close to such a change. Here we explore the research field that lies on the intersection of cyber security and quantum technologies research.,2019
The National Institute of Standards and Technology is in the process of selecting one or more public-key cryptographic algorithms through a public competition-like process. The new publickey cryptography standards will specify one or more additional digital signature public-key encryption and key-establishment algorithms to augment FIPS 186-4 Digital Signature Standard (DSS) as well as special publications SP 800-56A Revision 2 Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key Establishment Schemes Using Discrete Logarithm Cryptography and SP 800-56B Recommendation for Pair-Wise Key-Establishment Schemes Using Integer Factorization. It is intended that these algorithms will be capable of protecting sensitive information well into the foreseeable future including after the advent of quantum computers. In November 2017 82 candidate algorithms were submitted to NIST for consideration. Among these 69 met both the minimum acceptance criteria and our submission requirements and were accepted as First-Round Candidates on Dec. 20 2017 marking the beginning of the First Round of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process. This report describes the evaluation criteria and selection process based on public feedback and internal review of the first-round candidates and summarizes the 26 candidate algorithms announced on January 30 2019 for moving forward to the second round of the competition.

A real estate contract is a high-risk contract with a large amount of money and there are many problems in the risk and reliability of fraud. In particular online contracts have low reliability and high risk. If you can manage information on these issues and prevent forgery and duplication of contract information you can maintain low cost and high efficiency. Blockchain technology is being used as an alternative to the enormous cost and reliability issues associated with offline real estate contracts. When blockchain technology is applied to an online contract management system reliability and scalability are efficient and confidentiality can be ensured. However as real estate transactions using blockchain technology increase online problems arise in scalability. Therefore in this paper we implemented an Ethereum-based online real estate contract system that solved the scalability using the zero-knowledge proof algorithm. The real estate contract system enables online contract management and discrimination of contract forgery through blockchain. In particular it was possible to prevent fraud until the contract was concluded and the contract was terminated.,2021
Zero-Knowledge Proof is a cryptographic protocolexercised to render privacy and data security by securingthe identity of users and using services anonymously. It findsnumerous applications; authentication is one of them. A ZeroKnowledge Proof-based authentication system is discussed in thispaper. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Secure RemotePassword (SRP) protocol have been used to design and buildthe ZKP based authentication system. SRP is a broadly usedPassword Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol. Theproposed method overcomes several drawbacks of traditional andcommonly used authentication systems such as a simple usernameand plaintext password-based system multi-factor authenticationsystem and others,2021
Prior work has established that all problems in NP admit classical zero-knowledge proof systems and under reasonable hardness assumptions for quantum computations these proof systems can be made secure against quantum attacks. We prove a result representing a further quantum generalization of this fact which is that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum zero-knowledge proof system. More specifically assuming the existence of an unconditionally binding and quantum computationally concealing commitment scheme we prove that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a quantum interactive proof system that is zero-knowledge with respect to efficient quantum computations. Our QMA proof system is sound against arbitrary quantum provers but only requires an honest prover to perform polynomial-time quantum computations provided that it holds a quantum witness for a given instance of the QMA problem under consideration. The proof system relies on a new variant of the QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem in which the local terms are described by Clifford operations and standard basis measurements. We believe that the QMA-completeness of this problem may have other uses in quantum complexity.,2016
We provide several advances to the understanding of the class of Quantum Merlin-Arthur proof systems (QMA) the quantum analogue of NP. Our central contribution is proving a longstanding conjecture that the Consistency of Local Density Matrices (CLDM) problem is QMA-hard under Karp reductions. The input of CLDM consists of local reduced density matrices on sets of at most k qubits and the problem asks if there is an n-qubit global quantum state that is locally consistent with all of the k-qubit local density matrices. The containment of this problem in QMA and the QMA-hardness under Turing reductions were proved by Liu [APPROX-RANDOM 2006]. Liu also conjectured that CLDM is QMA-hard under Karp reductions which is desirable for applications and we finally prove this conjecture. We establish this result using the techniques of simulatable codes of Grilo Slofstra and Yuen [FOCS 2019] simplifying their proofs and tailoring them to the context of OMA. In order to develop applications of CLDM we propose a framework that we call locally simulatable proofs for QMA: this provides QMA proofs that can be efficiently verified by probing only k qubits and furthermore the reduced density matrix of any k-qubit subsystem of a good witness can be computed in polynomial time independently of the witness. Within this framework we show several advances in zero-knowledge in the quantum setting. We show for the first time a commit-and-open computational zero-knowledge proof system for all of QMA as a quantum analogue of a “sigma” protocol. We then define a Proof of Quantum Knowledge which guarantees that a prover is effectively in possession of a quantum witness in an interactive proof and show that our zero-knowledge proof system satisfies this definition. Finally we show that our proof system can be used to establish that QMA has a quantum non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system in the secret parameter setting.,2020
In this paper we present a simple bare-bones solution of a Zero-Knowledge authentication protocol which uses non-commutative algebra and a variation of the generalized symmetric decomposition problem (GSDP) as a one-way function. The cryptographic security is assured as long the GSDP problem is computationally hard to solve in non-commutative algebraic structures and belongs currently to the PQC category as no quantum computer attack is likely to exists.,2017
One of the most critical concerns in information security today is user authentication. There is a great security when using the text-based strong password schemes but often remembering those good passwords is very hard and users writing them down on a piece of paper or saving inside the smart phone. There is an alternative solution to the text-based authentication which is the Graphical User Authentication (GUA) or simply image-based Password based on the fact that humans tend to memorize images better. This type of approach allows users to create and remember passwords easily. However one big issues that is plaguing GUA is shoulder surfing attack that can capture the users mouse clicks and eavesdropping. In this paper a new algorithm that using zero-knowledge protocol as the solution to solving the eavesdropping and shoulder surfing attack to provide better system security. In zero-knowledge protocol users prove that they know the graphical password without sending it. In other words the user does not send the password to the verifier or reveal it to the people nearby. Hackers who try to eavesdrop the password will be failed since the password is not sent over the insecure channel such as Internet nor reveal. Therefore it is a secured approach to prevent interception by unwanted parties or adversary. The result that is going to be yielded in this project is a secured authentication approach which is user-friendly.without revealing anything other than the veracity of the statement tobe proven. After a formal definition of zero-knowledge proof schemesand a simple example zero-knowledge proofs for Graph Isomorphismand Graph 3-colorability are presented the latter being the basis forthe proof that all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs. Thepaper concludes with an application of zero-knowledge proofs in cryptography the Fiat-Shamir Indentification Protocol which is the basisfor modern zero-knowledge entity authentication schemes.,2018
The zero-knowledge proof of knowledge first defined by Fiat Fiege and Shamir was used by Galil Haber and Yung as a means of constructing (out of a trapdoor function) an interactive public-key cryptosystem provably secure against chosen ciphertext attack. We introduce a revised setting which permits the definition of a non-interactive analogue the non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge and show how it may be constructed in that setting from a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof system for N P (of the type introduced by Blum Feldman and Micali). We give a formalization of chosen ciphertext attack in our model which is stronger than the “lunchtime attack” considered by Naor and Yung and prove a non-interactive public-key cryptosystem based on non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of knowledge to be secure against it,2001
In this paper we show how to construct noninteractive zero knowledge proofs forany NP statement under general (rather than number theoretic) assumptions and how to enablepolynomially many provers to give polynomially many such proofs based on a single random string.Our constructions can be used in cryptographic applications in which the prover is restricted topolynomial time.,1999
Referring to the consensus mechanisms of traditional blockchain a new consensus mechanism of quantumblockchain is designed based on the randomness and the irreversibility of quantum measurement and quantumzero-knowledge proof. This new consensus mechanism does not involve a great deal of computing resources andhence has fewer energy consumption shorter time delay and higher throughput. Furthermore the new consensusmechanism could withstand 51% attack.,2021
The traditional centralized digital identity management system (DIMS) has been subjectto threats such as fragmented identity single point of failure internal attacks and privacyleakage. Emerging blockchain technology allows DIMSs to be deployed in it which largelyalleviates the problems caused by the centralized third party but its inherent transparencyand lack of privacy pose a huge challenge to DIMSs. In this regard we leverage the smartcontracts and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) algorithms to improve the existing claim identitymodel in blockchain to realize the identity unlinkability effectively avoiding the exposure ofthe ownership of attributes. Furthermore we implement a system prototype named BZDIMSthat includes a challenge-response protocol which allows users to selectively disclose theirownership of attributes to service providers to protect users’ behavior privacy. Performanceevaluation and security analysis show that our scheme achieves effective attribute privacyprotection and a wider application scope compared with the prior model.,2020
It has been predicted that more devices will be connected to the internet network along with the development of IoT and that will increase the complexity in the security system. The most important thing in security systems is the process of encryption and authentication. Various encryption techniques are developed to overcome security problems of the data. One of the methods used for authentication of data is Zero Knowledge Proof. This method works to identify the authenticity of someones statement to proof without showing any knowledge of the statement mentioned. This research will mainly discuss about the security of data transmission system by combining data encryption and data authentication. The proposed data encryption is using Advanced Encryption System and method for authentication of data using the Zero Knowledge Proof. This research will conduct the development methods of authentication Zero Knowledge Proof from previous research and the result was compared with the proposed method based on the simulation results transmission system client and server. Experiments will be conducted using thirty-text data each of data will be measured on the performance of both encryption and authentication process between the previous method and proposed method. Experimental results show the performance of the proposed method has better speed to process application for security of data transmission systems with performance to authenticate approximately 5 ms from the client side and server side.,2021
Nowadays distributed ledger technology or blockchain is widely used in the corporate sector for various industries. Although implementation issues (coding practice lack of capabilities etc.) are not among the major barriers for the technology adaption there are still some informational security challenges to adjust and scale blockchain networks for corporate usage. One of them is to provide functionality for private transactions stored in a blockchain. Some methods including mix networks ring signatures and off-chain protocols were applied to meet the privacy requirements. However these methods have some limitations associated with the key blockchain characteristics such as decentralized storing system and immutability verification of private data. This article examines zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) methods for corporate blockchain networks. The article provides the review of existing methods for private transactions discovers the implementation of ZKP methods also performance and scalability issues are discussed.,2021
In this work we consider the interplay between multiprover interactive proofs quantum entanglement and zero knowledge proofs - notions that are central pillars of complexity theory quantum information and cryptography. In particular we study the relationship between the complexity class MIP* the set of languages decidable by multiprover interactive proofs with quantumly entangled provers and the class PZK-MIP* which is the set of languages decidable by MIP* protocols that furthermore possess the perfect zero knowledge property. Our main result is that the two classes are equal i.e. MIP* = PZK-MIP*. This result provides a quantum analogue of the celebrated result of Ben-Or Goldwasser Kilian and Wigderson (STOC 1988) who show that MIP = PZK-MIP (in other words all classical multiprover interactive protocols can be made zero knowledge). We prove our result by showing that every MIP* protocol can be efficiently transformed into an equivalent zero knowledge MIP* protocol in a manner that preserves the completeness-soundness gap. Combining our transformation with previous results we obtain the corollaries that i) all languages that can be solved in non-deterministic double exponential time have zero knowledge MIP* protocols and ii) all co-recursively enumerable languages (which include undecidable problems as well as all decidable problems) have zero knowledge MIP* protocols with vanishing promise gap.,2019
Abstract. We study the notion of zero-knowledge secure against quantum polynomial-time verifiers (referred to as quantum zero-knowledge)in the concurrent composition setting. Despite being extensively studiedin the classical setting concurrent composition in the quantum settinghas hardly been studied.We initiate a formal study of concurrent quantum zero-knowledge.Our results are as follows:– Bounded Concurrent QZK for NP and QMA: Assuming postquantum one-way functions there exists a quantum zero-knowledgeproof system for NP in the bounded concurrent setting. In this setting we fix a priori the number of verifiers that can simultaneouslyinteract with the prover. Under the same assumption we also showthat there exists a quantum zero-knowledge proof system for QMAin the bounded concurrency setting.– Quantum Proofs of Knowledge: Assuming quantum hardnessof learning with errors (QLWE) there exists a bounded concurrentzero-knowledge proof system for NP satisfying quantum proof ofknowledge property.Our extraction mechanism simultaneously allows for extraction probability to be negligibly close to acceptance probability(extractability) and also ensures that the prover’s state after extraction is statistically close to the prover’s state after interacting withthe verifier (simulatability).Even in the standalone setting the seminal work of [Unruh EUROCRYPT’12] and all its followups satisfied a weaker version ofextractability property and moreover did not achieve simulatability. Our result yields a proof of quantum knowledge system for QMAwith better parameters than prior works.,2021
As cloud computing becomes more popularresearch has focused on usable solutions to the problem ofverifiable computation (VC) where a computationally weakdevice (Verifier) outsources a program execution to a power-ful server (Prover) and receives guarantees that the executionwas performed faithfully. A Prover can further demonstrateknowledge of a secret input that causes the Verifier’s programto satisfy certain assertions without ever revealing which inputwas used. State-of-the-art Zero-Knowledge Proofs of Knowledge(ZKPK) methods encode a computation using arithmetic circuitsand preserve the privacy of Prover’s inputs while attestingthe integrity of program execution. Nevertheless developingdebugging and optimizing programs as circuits remains a daunt-ing task as most users are unfamiliar with this programmingparadigm. In this work we present Zilch a framework that accel-erates and simplifies the deployment of VC and ZKPK for anyapplication transparently i.e. without the need of trusted setup.Zilch uses traditional instruction sequences rather than staticarithmetic circuits that would need to be regenerated for eachdifferent computation. Towards that end we have implementedZ MIPS: a MIPS-like processor model that allows verifying eachinstruction independently and compose a proof for the executionof the target application. To foster usability Zilch incorporates anovel cross-compiler from an object-oriented Java-like languagetailored to ZKPK and optimized our Z MIPS model as well as apowerful API that enables integration of ZKPK within existingC/C++ programs. In our experiments we demonstrate theflexibility of Zilch using two real-life applications and evaluateProver and Verifier performance on a variety of benchmarks,2021
As an essential means of privacy protection technology zero-knowledge proof has gradually been applied into various fields with the development of blockchain technology such as the Internet of Vehicles and Bitcoin. Personal comprehensive credit score as a measure to promote social governance is closely related to personal privacy. Although there are currently credit score calculation systems for various application scenarios these systems almost ignore user privacy protection which leads to user information leakage or abuse. The combination of zero-knowledge proof and personal credit score calculation has been studied by a number of researchers at the present stage. However all data are provided by users directly in the current schemes which did not consider the data authenticity under the situation that users provided false data. In this paper we utilize zero-knowledge proof to design a novel privacy protection scheme for personal credit score calculation taking into account the authenticity verification of multi-dimensional user data. In addition our scheme also proposes the concept of a universal verification platform based on blockchain for personal credit scores. This platform has more substantial applicability and versatility for any qualified institution that requires querying and verifying user’s credit scores. At the end of the paper we conducted a security analysis and performance evaluation for the overall scheme.,2021
One possible applicability of blockchain technology is in identity management. Especially for public blockchains the need to reduce (ideally to zero) the exposure of sensitive identification data is clear. Under these settings zero-knowledge proofs in particular in the advanced forms of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive ARguments of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) and Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent ARguments of Knowledge (zk-STARK) can be used as a potential privacy-preserving technique. The current work looks at the existing libraries that implement zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs and exemplifies and discusses the use of zk-SNARKs in blockchain-based identity management solutions.,2021
Human dignity demands that personal information like medical and forensic data be hidden from the public. But veils of secrecy designed to preserve privacy may also be abused to cover up lies and deceit by institutions entrusted with Data unjustly harming citizens and eroding trust in central institutions. Zero knowledge (ZK) proof systems are an ingenious cryptographic solution to this tension between the ideals of personal privacy and institutional integrity enforcing the latter in a way that does not compromise the former. Public trust demands transparency from ZK systems meaning they be set up with no reliance on any trusted party and have no trapdoors that could be exploited by powerful parties to bear false witness. For ZK systems to be used with Big Data it is imperative that the public verification process scale sublinearly in data size. Transparent ZK proofs that can be verified exponentially faster than data size were first described in the 1990s but early constructions were impractical and no ZK system realized thus far in code (including that used by crypto-currencies like Zcash™) has achieved both transparency and exponential verification speedup simultaneously for general computations. Here we report the first realization of a transparent ZK system (ZK-STARK) in which verification scales exponentially faster than database size and moreover this exponential speedup in verification is observed concretely for meaningful and sequential computations described next. Our system uses several recent advances on interactive oracle proofs (IOP) such as a “fast” (linear time) IOP system for error correcting codes. Our proof-of-concept system allows the Police to prove to the public that the DNA profile of a Presidential Candidate does not appear in the forensic DNA profile database maintained by the Police. The proof which is generated by the Police relies on no external trusted party and reveals no further information about the contents of the database nor about the candidate’s profile. In particular no DNA information is disclosed to any party outside the Police. The proof is shorter than the size of the DNAdatabase and verified faster than the time needed to examine that database na¨ıvely,2018
The goal of this work is to provide a positive result of quantum obfuscation. Point functions have been widely discussed in classical obfuscation theory but yet not formally defined in the quantum setting. To analyze the obfuscatability of quantum point functions we start with preliminaries on quantum obfuscation giving out the oracleimplementable relationship of two quantum circuit families and some obfuscations o combined quantum circuits. Then we present the strict definition of a quantum point function and discuss its variants of multiple points and multiple qubits. Under the quantum-accessible random oracle model we obtain the obfuscatability of quantum point function families by means of reduction. Finally we discuss the application of quantum obfuscation in quantum zero-knowledge. As a start of study on quantum point functions our work will be inspiring in the future development of quantum obfuscation theory.,2019
We construct a constant-round zero-knowledge classical argumentfor NP secure against quantum attacks. We assume the existence of Quantum Fully-Homomorphic Encryption and other standardprimitives known based on the Learning with Errors Assumption for quantum algorithms. As a corollary we also obtain a constantround zero-knowledge quantum argument for QMA.At the heart of our protocol is a new no-cloning non-black-box simulation technique.,2020
One of the approaches to constructing zero knowledge (ZK) arguments relies on “PCP techniques” that date back to influential works from the early 1990’s [Babai et al. Arora et al. 1991-2]. These techniques require only minimal cryptographic assumptions namely the existence of a family of collision-resistant hash functions [Kilian STOC 1992] and achieve two remarkable properties: (i) all messages generated by the verifier are public random coins and (ii) total verification time is merely poly-logarithmic in the time needed to naïvely execute the computation being verified [Babai et al. STOC 1991]. Those early constructions were never realized in code mostly because proving time was too large. To address this the model of interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) which generalizes the PCP model was recently suggested. Proving time for ZK-IOPs was reduced to quasi-linear even for problems that require nondeterministic exponential time to decide [Ben-Sasson et al. TCC 2016 ICALP 2017]. Despite these recent advances it was still not clear whether ZK-IOP systems can lead to concretely efficient succinct argument systems. Our main claim is that this is indeed the case. We present a new construction of an IOP of knowledge (which we call a zk-STIK) that improves asymptotically on the state of art: for log-space computations of length T it is the first to   𝑂(𝑇log𝑇)  arithmetic prover complexity and   𝑂(log𝑇)  verifier arithmetic complexity. Prior IOPs had additional   𝗉𝗈𝗅𝗒log𝑇  factors in both prover and verifier. Additionally we report a C++ realization of this system (which we call libSTARK). Compared to prevailing ZK realizations it has the fastest proving and (total) verification time for sufficiently large sequential computations.,2019
The potential development of large-scale quantum computers is raising concerns among IT and security research professionals due to their ability to solve (elliptic curve) discrete logarithm and integer factorization problems in polynomial time. All currently used public key algorithms would be deemed insecure in a post-quantum (PQ) setting. In response the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a process to standardize quantum-resistant crypto algorithms focusing primarily on their security guarantees. Since PQ algorithms present significant differences over classical ones their overall evaluation should not be performed out-of-context. This work presents a detailed performance evaluation of the NIST signature algorithm candidates and investigates the imposed latency on TLS 1.3 connection establishment under realistic network conditions. In addition we investigate their impact on TLS session throughput and analyze the trade-off between lengthy PQ signatures and computationally heavy PQ cryptographic operations. Our results demonstrate that the adoption of at least two PQ signature algorithms would be viable with little additional overhead over current signature algorithms. Also we argue that many NIST PQ candidates can effectively be used for less time-sensitive applications and provide an in-depth discussion on the integration of PQ authentication in encrypted tunneling protocols along with the related challenges improvements and alternatives. Finally we propose and evaluate the combination of different PQ signature algorithms across the same certificate chain in TLS. Results show a reduction of the TLS handshake time and a significant increase of a servers TLS tunnel connection rate over using a single PQ signature scheme.,2020
In a recent seminal work Bitansky and Shmueli (STOC ’20)gave the first construction of a constant round zero-knowledge argumentfor NP secure against quantum attacks. However their constructionhas several drawbacks compared to the classical counterparts. Specifi-cally their construction only achieves computational soundness requiresstrong assumptions of quantum hardness of learning with errors (QLWEassumption) and the existence of quantum fully homomorphic encryp-tion (QFHE) and relies on non-black-box simulation.In this paper we resolve these issues at the cost of weakening thenotion of zero-knowledge to what is called -zero-knowledge. Concretelywe construct the following protocols:– We construct a constant round interactive proof for NP that sat-isfies statistical soundness and black-box -zero-knowledge against quan-tum attacks assuming the existence of collapsing hash functions whichis a quantum counterpart of collision-resistant hash functions. Interest-ingly this construction is just an adapted version of the classical protocolby Goldreich and Kahan (JoC ’96) though the proof of -zero-knowledgeproperty against quantum adversaries requires novel ideas.– We construct a constant round interactive argument for NPthat satisfies computational soundness and black-box -zero-knowledgeagainst quantum attacks only assuming the existence of post-quantumone-way functions.At the heart of our results is a new quantum rewinding techniquethat enables a simulator to extract a committed message of a maliciousverifier while simulating verifier’s internal state in an appropriate sense.,2021
We study post-quantum zero-knowledge (classical) protocols that are sound against quantum resetting attacks. Our model is inspired by the classical model of resetting provers (Barak-Goldreich-Goldwasser-Lindell FOCS ‘01) providing a malicious efficient prover with oracle access to the verifier’s next-message-function fixed to some initial random tape; thereby allowing it to effectively reset (or equivalently rewind) the verifier. In our model the prover has quantum access to the verifier’s function and in particular can query it in superposition.The motivation behind quantum resettable soundness is twofold: First ensuring a strong security guarantee in scenarios where quantum resetting may be possible (e.g. smart cards or virtual machines). Second drawing intuition from the classical setting we hope to improve our understanding of basic questions regarding post-quantum zero knowledge.We prove the following results: Black-Box Barriers. Quantum resetting exactly captures the power of black-box zero knowledge quantum simulators. Accordingly resettable soundness cannot be achieved in conjunction with black-box zero knowledge except for languages in 𝐁𝐐𝐏. Leveraging this we prove that constant-round public-coin or three message protocols cannot be black-box post-quantum zero-knowledge. For this we show how to transform such protocols into quantumly resettably sound ones. The transformations are similar to classical ones but their analysis is very different due to the essential difference between classical and quantum resetting.  A Resettably-Sound Non-Black-Box Zero-Knowledge Protocol. Under the (quantum) Learning with Errors assumption and quantum fully-homomorphic encryption we construct a post-quantum resettably-sound zero knowledge protocol for 𝐍𝐏. We rely on non-black-box simulation techniques thus overcoming the black-box barrier for such protocols.  From Resettable Soundness to The Impossibility of Quantum Obfuscation. Assuming one-way functions we prove that any quantumly-resettably-sound zero-knowledge protocol for 𝐍𝐏 implies the impossibility of quantum obfuscation. Combined with the above result this gives an alternative proof to several recent results on quantum unobfuscatability.,2021
In this paper we create secure SSL protocol with zero-knowledge proof which proposed an intruder should not be able to substitute false certificates and masquerade as client or sever. We add Zero-Knowledge proof where certificate transfer directly into both parties. The new scheme was shown to be more secure against the known attacks for SSL. This protocol has characteristics which have identification and authentication of both parties when use to SSL handshake protocol.,2018
Currently the Internet of Things (IoT) is widely used by the emerging of internet-integrated wireless devices in daily life. In order to communicate and exchange data with each other IoT devices must pass by a gateway that belongs to the same network. But considering the mobility of such devices and their constraints it becomes difficult to trust and to connect from a gateway to another. Therefore this paper introduces a blockchain-based secure handover protocol. It ensures an anonymous mutual authentication solution between a mobile IoT device and a visited gateway by using Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) protocol. To do simulations have been performed thanks to a discrete events simulator. In addition to a good security level compared with the most used protocol (DTLS) our simulation results lead to better performance in terms of temporal complexity energy consumption and communication cost.,2021
Picnic is a hash-based cryptographic algorithm which claims to provide a signature scheme that is unforgeable against quantum computers; it is the seventh such algorithm we consider in-depth of the eight in this book. This algorithm is divided into three components: key generation signature generation and signature verification. We select three variants of Picnic with distinct security strength and make these variants capable of synthesis by a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool. We summarize all the changes in the C code to make it capable of synthesis. Using HLS we generate FPGA and ASIC designs for all three components of the three variants. We evaluate power area speed and security parameter trade-offs for Picnic hardware architectures. We explore the design-space through a detailed analysis of FPGA and ASIC designs for Picnic concluding that for the FPGA implementation latency increases with security but with minimal change in hardware overhead while for the ASIC-specific implementation the baseline version provides the best throughput at security level 1 but for security levels 3 and 5 the pipelined implementations have shorter execution times.,2020
In last years there has been an increasing efort to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT) including blockchain.One of the main topics of interest given its importance is the research and development of privacy mechanisms as forexample is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide informa-tion that is put into the ledger while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe diferentstrategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP) as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed)Advances in cryptology—EUROCRYPT 2000 Springer Berlin 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in:Josef (ed) Advances in cryptology—ASIACRYPT 2008 Springer Berlin 2008) and bulletproofs (Bünz et al. in: 2018 IEEEsymposium on security and privacy (SP) 2018) proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possibleuse cases. Since bulletproofs (Bünz et al. 2018) is the most efcient construction we will give a detailed description of itsalgorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efcient than previous schemes but also avoids the trustedsetup which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies ifthe setup phase is compromised it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly bulletproofs canalso be used to construct generic ZKP in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements and thus it is not onlyrestricted to ZKRP but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerfultool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Alsowe present our implementation which was open sourced (Morais et al. in: Zero knowledge range proof implementation2018. https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof).,2019
The adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology is increasing at a fast rate. With improving software technologies and growing security threats there is always a need to upgrade the firmware in the IoT devices. Digital signatures are an integral part of digital communication to cope with the threat of these devices being exploited by attackers to run malicious commands codes or patches on them. Digital Signatures measure the authenticity of the transmitted data as well as are a source of record keeping (repudiation). This study proposes the adoption of Lamport signature scheme which is quantum resistant for authentication of data transmission and its feasibility in IoT devices.,2018
This chapter gives an overview of current developments in cryptographic algorithmic solutions against upcoming threats posed by quantum computers as well as unsolved problems in the classical IT landscape. It is an update of our 2018 publication in Computeralgebra-Rundbrief (Bogomolec und Gerhard 2018) and contains some new developments. However the mathematics described are of course still the same. We thank the Fachgruppe Computeralgebra for their support.,2021
We propose a new class of post-quantum digital signature schemes that: (a) derive their security entirely from the security of symmetric-key primitives believed to be quantum-secure and (b) have extremely small keypairs and (c) are highly parameterizable. In our signature constructions the public key is an image y =f (x) of a one-way function f and secret key x. A signature is a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof of x that incorporates a message to be signed. For this proof we leverage recent progress of Giacomelli et al. (USENIX’16) in constructing an efficient Σ-protocol for statements over general circuits. We improve this Σ-protocol to reduce proof sizes by a factor of two at no additional computationalcost. While this is of independent interest as it yields more compact proofs for any circuit it also decreases our signature sizes. We consider two possibilities to make the proof non-interactive: the Fiat-Shamir transform and Unruh’s transform (EUROCRYPT’12 ’15’16). The former has smaller signatures while the latter has a security analysis in the quantum-accessible random oracle model. By customizing Unruh’s transform to our application the overhead is reduced to 1.6x when compared to the Fiat-Shamir transform which does not have a rigorous post-quantum security analysis. We implement and benchmark both approaches and explore the possible choice of f  taking advantage of the recent trend to strive for practical symmetric ciphers with a particularly low number of multiplications and end up using LowMC (EUROCRYPT’15),2017
Recent work including ZKBoo ZKB++ and Ligero has developed efficient non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge (NIZKPoKs) for Boolean circuits based on symmetric-key primitives alone using the “MPC-in-the-head” paradigm of Ishai et al. We show how to instantiate this paradigm with MPC protocols in the preprocessing model; once optimized this results in an NIZKPoK with shorter proofs (and comparable computation) as in prior work for circuits containing roughly 300–100000 AND gates. In contrast to prior work our NIZKPoK also supports witness-independent preprocessing which allows the prover to shift most of its work to an offline phase before the witness is known. We use our NIZKPoK to construct a signature scheme based only on symmetric-key primitives (and hence with “post-quantum” security). The resulting scheme has shorter signatures than the scheme built using ZKB++ (and comparable signing/verification time) and is even competitive with hash-based signature schemes. To further highlight the flexibility and power of our NIZKPoK we also use it to build efficient ring and group signatures based on symmetric-key primitives alone. To our knowledge the resulting schemes are the most efficient constructions of these primitives that offer post-quantum security.,2018
While basic lattice-based primitives like encryption and digital signature schemes are already fairly short more advanced privacy-preserving protocols (e.g. group signatures) that are believed to be post-quantum secure have outputs of at least several hundred kilobytes. In this paper we propose a framework for building privacy protocols with significantly smaller parameter sizes whose secrecy is based on post-quantum assumptions but soundness additionally assumes that some classical assumption e.g. the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) is hard to break within a short amount of time.The main ingredients of our constructions are statistical zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge for certain relations whose soundness rely on the hardness of solving the discrete logarithm problem for a fresh DLP instance per proof. This notion has recently been described by the term quantum annoyance. Using such proofs while also enforcing that they be completed in a fixed amount of time we then show how to construct privacy-preserving primitives such as (dynamic) group signatures and DAA schemes where soundness is based on the hardness of the “timed” discrete logarithm problem and SIS. The outputs of our schemes are significantly shorter (  ≈30𝑋)  than purely lattice-based schemes.,2020
"This paper presents a theoretical approach to zero-knowledge authentication using left self-distributive (LD) algebraic systems like Laver tables. The reason for using Laver tables is that their combinatorial properties seem quite complicated and as cited involve necessarily fast growing functions. Post-Quantum cryptography explores solutions whose security do not rely on traditional numeric fields one-way trap functions based on integer factorization or discrete logarithm problems. The paper shows at first the method after that it states as a theorem that the authentication protocol complies with a zero-knowledge proof and finally proves it. No attempt or effort has been made to develop a practical instance and the paper focus only on the theoretical aspects of the question. Despite this we sketch the potential use of Laver tables.

` The security and privacy of healthcare enterprises(HEs) are crucial because they maintain sensitive informa-tion. Because of the unique functional requirement of omni-inclusiveness HEs are expected to monitor patients allowingfor connectivity with vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).In the absence of literature on security provisioning frameworksthat connect VANETs and HEs this paper presents a smartzero-knowledge proof and statistical fingerprinting-based trustedsecure communication framework for a fog computing environ-ment. A zero-knowledge proof is used for vehicle authenticationand statistical fingerprinting is employed to secure communi-cation between VANETs and HEs. Authenticity verification ofthe operations is performed at the on-board unit (OBU) fittedin the vehicle based on the service executions at the residenthardware platform. The processor clock cycles are acquired fromthe service executions in a complete sandboxed environment.The calculated cycles assist in developing the blueprint signaturefor the particular OBU of the vehicle. Hence the fingerprintsignature helps build trust and plays a key role in authenticatingthe vehicle’s horizontal movement to everything or to differentsections of the HEs. In an environment enabled for fog computingour novel model can provide efficient remote monitoring,2021
In recent years as one of the new advanced manufacturing modes cloud manufacturing has been received wide attentionsaround the world. The technology of cloud manufacturing intergrades the services-oriented techniques as well as manufac-turing processes based on cloud computing. With the aid of the cloud computing platforms the manufacturing services areprovided in manufacturing clouds. However one of the key challenges of cloud manufacturing is the security and safetyof information transmission. Traditional network security architectures are based on RSA and elliptic curve cryptographicsystems which is claimed to be broken on quantum computers. We exploit the countermeasures of post-quantum algorithmsto protect cloud manufacturing against quantum computer attacks. We propose a post-quantum secure scheme for cloudmanufacturing. First in order to retain confidentiality in cloud manufacturing we propose a post-quantum asymmetric-keyencryption scheme to encrypt the message with the generated session key. Second in order to retain authentication securityin cloud manufacturing we propose a post-quantum public-key signature generation scheme. Third based on the encryptionscheme and signature generation scheme we propose a post-quantum secure communication system for cloud manufactur-ing. We implement our design on cloud-based environment and the comparison with related designs show that our design issuitable for protecting communication in cloud manufacturing. Besides the post-quantum secure communication system canbe extended to other applications of intelligent manufacturing,2020
The on-demand mobility market including ridesharing is becoming increasingly important with e-hailing fares growing at a rate of approximately 130% per annum since 2013. By increasing utilization of existing vehicles and empty seats ridesharing can provide many benefits including reduced traffic congestion and environmental impact from vehicle usage and production. However the safety of riders and drivers has become of paramount concern and a method for privacy-preserving identity verification between untrusted parties is essential for protecting users. To this end we propose a novel privacy-preserving identity verification system extending zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) and blockchain for use in ridesharing applications. We design a permissioned blockchain network to perform the ZKP verification of a drivers identity which also acts as an immutable ledger to store ride logs and ZKP records. For the ZKP module we design a protocol to facilitate user verification without requiring the exchange of any private information. We prototype the proposed system on the Hyperledger Fabric platform with the Hyperledger Ursa cryptography library and conduct extensive experimentation. To measure the prototypes performance we utilize the Hyperledger Caliper benchmark tool to perform extensive analysis and the results show that our system is suitable for use in real-world ridesharing applications.,2020
Performing a fair exchange without a Trusted Third Party (TTP) was considered to be impossible. With multi party computation and practices like Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain accomplishes a fair exchange in a trustless network. Data confidentiality is a key challenge that has to be resolved before adopting blockchain for enterprise applications where tokenized assets will be transferred. Protocols like Zcash are already providing the same for financial transactions but lacks flexibility required to apply in most of the potential use cases of blockchain. Most of the real world application work in a way where a transaction is carried out when a particular action is performed. Also the zero knowledge proof method used in Zcash ZKSNARK has certain weaknesses restricting its adoption. One of the major drawbacks of ZKSNARK is that it requires an initial trust setup phase which is difficult to achieve in blockchain ecosystem. ZKSTARK an interactive zero knowledge proof does not require this phase and also provides security against post quantum attacks. We propose a system that uses two indistinguishable hash functions along with ZKSTARK to improve the flexibility of blockchain platforms. The two indistinguishable hash functions are chosen from SHA3-finalists based on their security performance and inner designs.,2019
We investigate all NIST PQC Round 3 KEM candidates from the viewpoint of fault-injection attacks: Classic McEliece Kyber NTRU Saber BIKE FrodoKEM HQC NTRU Prime and SIKE. All KEM schemes use variants of the Fujisaki-Okamoto transformation so the equality test with re-encryption in decapsulation is critical.We survey effective key-recovery attacks when we can skip the equality test. We found the existing key-recovery attacks against Kyber NTRU Saber FrodoKEM HQC one of two KEM schemes in NTRU Prime and SIKE. We propose a new key-recovery attack against the other KEM scheme in NTRU Prime. We also report an attack against BIKE that leads to leakage of information of secret keys.The open-source pqm4 library contains all KEM schemes except Classic McEliece and HQC. We show that giving a single instruction-skipping fault in the decapsulation processes leads to skipping the equality test virtually for Kyber NTRU Saber BIKE and SIKE. We also report the experimental attacks against them. We also report the implementation of NTRU Prime allows chosen-ciphertext attacks freely and the timing side-channel of FrodoKEM reported in Guo Johansson and Nilsson (CRYPTO 2020) remains while there are no such bugs in their NIST PQC Round 3 submissions.,2021
Post-quantum cryptography has known a Cambrian explosion in the last decade. What started as a very theoretical and mathematical area has now evolved into a sprawling research field complete with side-channel resistant embedded implementations large scale deployment tests and standardization efforts. This study systematizes the current state of knowledge on post-quantum cryptography. Compared to existing studies we adopt a transversal point of view and center our study around three areas: (i) paradigms (ii) implementation (iii) deployment. Our point of view allows to cast almost all classical and post-quantum schemes into just a few paradigms. We highlight trends common methodologies and pitfalls to look for and recurrent challenges.,2021
Crystals-Dilithium is one of the digital-signature algorithms in NIST’s ongoing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization final round. Security and computational efficiency concerning software and hardware implementations are the primary criteria for PQC standardization. Many studies were conducted to efficiently apply Dilithium in various environments; however they are focused on traditionally used PC and 32-bit Advanced RISC Machine (ARM) processors (Cortex-M4). ARMv8-based processors are more advanced embedded microcontrollers (MCUs) and have been widely used for various IoT devices edge computing devices and On-Board Units in autonomous driving cars. In this study we present an efficient Crystals-Dilithium implementation on ARMv8-based MCU. To enhance Dilithium’s performance we optimize number theoretic transform (NTT)-based polynomial multiplication the core operation of Dilithium by leveraging ARMv8’s architectural properties such as large register sets and NEON engine. We apply task parallelism to NTT-based polynomial multiplication using the NEON engine. In addition we reduced the number of memory accesses during NTT-based polynomial multiplication with the proposed merging and register-holding techniques. Finally we present an interleaved NTT-based multiplication simultaneously executed with ARM processor and NEON engine. This implementation can further optimize performance by eliminating the ARM processor latency with NEON overheads. Through the proposed optimization methods for Dilithium 3 we achieved a performance improvement of about 43.83% in key pair generation 113.25% in signing and 41.92% in verification compared to the reference implementation submitted to the final round of the NIST PQC competition.,2022
CRYSTALS-Dilithium is a lattice-based cryptography algorithm which claims to provide a signature scheme that is unforgeable against quantum-computers; it is the first such algorithm we consider in-depth of the eight in this book. This algorithm has three components: key generation signature generation and signature verification. We select four variants of CRYSTALS-Dilithium with distinct security strength and make these variants capable of synthesis by a High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tool. We summarize all the changes in the C code to make it capable of synthesis. Using HLS we generate FPGA and ASIC designs for all three components of the four variants. For CRYSTALS-Dilithium hardware architectures we evaluate trade-offs in power area speed and security. We explore the design-space through a detailed analysis of FPGA and ASIC designs. The evaluation leads to the conclusion that the FPGA implementation of Dilithium’s security level 3 variant has the highest latency and area overhead while its ASIC-specific implementation shows that it has the best security with minimal latency and area overhead.,2020
Post-quantum cryptographic primitives have a range of trade-offs compared to traditional public key algorithms either having slower computation or larger public keys and ciphertexts/signatures or both. While the performance of these algorithms in isolation is easy to measure and has been a focus of optimization techniques performance in realistic network conditions has been less studied. Google and Cloudflare have reported results from running experiments with post-quantum key exchange algorithms in the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol with real users’ network traffic. Such experiments are highly realistic but cannot be replicated without access to Internet-scale infrastructure and do not allow for isolating the effect of individual network characteristics.In this work we develop and make use of a framework for running such experiments in TLS cheaply by emulating network conditions using the networking features of the Linux kernel. Our testbed allows us to independently control variables such as link latency and packet loss rate and then examine the performance impact of various post-quantum-primitives on TLS connection establishment specifically hybrid elliptic curve/post-quantum key exchange and post-quantum digital signatures based on implementations from the Open Quantum Safe project. Among our key results we observe that packet loss rates above 3–5% start to have a significant impact on post-quantum algorithms that fragment across many packets such as those based on unstructured lattices. The results from this emulation framework are also complemented by results on the latency of loading entire web pages over TLS in real network conditions which show that network latency hides most of the impact from algorithms with slower computations (such as supersingular isogenies).,2020
Experts forecast that quantum computers can break classical cryptographic algorithms. Scientists are developing postquantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms that are invulnerable to quantum computer attacks. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started a public evaluation process to standardize quantum-resistant public key algorithms. The objective of our study is to provide a hardware-based comparison of the NIST PQC candidates. For this we use a High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design methodology to map high-level C specifications of round 2 PQC candidates into both FPGA and ASIC implementations.,2019
Large scale quantum computers will break classical public-key cryptography protocols by quantum algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm. Hence designing quantum-safe cryptosystems to replace current classical algorithms is crucial. Luckily there are some post-quantum candidates that are assumed to be resistant against future attacks from quantum computers and NIST is considering standardizing them. Among these candidates lattice-based cryptography sounds more interesting than others due to the performance results as well as confidence in the security. There are few works in the literature evaluating the performance of lattice-based cryptography in hardware. In this paper we focus on Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices (CRYSTALS) key exchange mechanisms known as Kyber and provide an instruction-set hardware architecture and implement on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA for performance evaluation and testing. Our proposed architecture provides an efficient and high-performance set of components to perform polynomial sampling number-theoretic transform (NTT) and point-wise multiplication to speed up lattice-based post-quantum cryptography (PQC). This architecture implemented on ASIC outperforms state-of-the-art implementations.,2021
Designing code-based signatures is both an important and challenging problem. A standard way to tackle it consists to use the Fiat-Shamir heuristic along with an identification scheme that is required to be zero-knowledge. The authors of [1] have highlighted an issue within the zero-knowledge proof of the Veron identification scheme [2]. It turns out that the zero-knowledge proof of the AGS protocol [3] is impacted in a similar way. In this paper we present a masking technique that solves the aforementioned issue without inducing any performance penalty. We introduce the Masked Veron and Masked AGS protocols that both leverage this masking technique and provide their zero-knowledge proofs. In addition we present a new technique improving the performances of signatures built from code-based identification schemes subject to the attack described in [4]. The Masked Veron and Masked AGS protocols feature all the existing performance improvements from the literature.,2021
A proof system can be used by a prover to demonstrate to one or more verifiers that a statement is true. Proof systems can be interactive where the prover and verifier exchange many messages or non-interactive where the prover sends a single convincing proof to the verifier. Proof systems are widely used in cryptographic protocols to verify that a party is following a protocol correctly and is not cheating.A particular type of proof systems are zero-knowledge proof systems where the prover convinces the verifier that the statement is true but does not leak any other information. Zero-knowledge proofs are useful when the prover has private data that should not be leaked but needs to demonstrate a certain fact about this data. The prover may for instance want to show it is following a protocol correctly but not want to reveal its own input.In these lecture notes we give an overview of some central techniques behind the construction of efficient zero-knowledge proofs.,2016
Upgradation of technologies for sustainable smart cities has led to rapid growth in Internet of Things (IoT) applications including e-healthcare services wherein smart devices collect patient data and deliver it remotely to the servers in real-time. Despite its enormous benefits IoT in healthcare has not received much attention primarily due to the risk of unauthorized access to confidential medical information enabled by the vulnerable wireless channel for communication. Besides tiny IoT devices have limited computing power and storage capabilities that prevent administrators from using complex and resource-hungry security protocols. The cyber attacks on the Internet of Healthcare applications (IoHA) could result in fatalities decreased revenue and reputation loss hence endangering sustainability. The existing security protocols are unsuitable due to the cost complexities that necessitate developing new security protocols for resource-constrained and heterogeneous IoT networks. We introduce a confidentiality and anonymity-preserving scheme for critical infrastructures of IoT to conquer cyber threats for sustainable healthcare. This paper proposes Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) based Authenticated Key Agreement (AKA) protocol for IoHA. ZKP-AKA uses zero-knowledge proofs physically unclonable function biometrics symmetric cryptography message digest etc. for accomplishing the protocol’s objective at minimal computation storage and communication expenses. ZKP-AKA retains data integrity confidentiality anonymity and safety from significant cyber threats.,2022
The verification of nuclear warheads for arms control involves a paradox: international inspectors will have to gain high confidence in the authenticity of submitted items while learning nothing about them. Proposed inspection systems featuring ‘information barriers’ designed to hide measurements stored in electronic systems are at risk of tampering and snooping. Here we show the viability of a fundamentally new approach to nuclear warhead verification that incorporates a zero-knowledge protocol which is designed in such a way that sensitive information is never measured and so does not need to be hidden. We interrogate submitted items with energetic neutrons making in effect differential measurements of both neutron transmission and emission. Calculations for scenarios in which material is diverted from a test object show that a high degree of discrimination can be achieved while revealing zero information. Our ideas for a physical zero-knowledge system could have applications beyond the context of nuclear disarmament. The proposed technique suggests a way to perform comparisons or computations on personal or confidential data without measuring the data in the first place.,2014
Importance of Internet of Things technologies increased in recent years. However these technologies carry some security vulnerabilities because of their network communication layer. The root cause of these vulnerabilities is usually the Authentication problem. Zero knowledge proof method is a strong cryptographic solution for Authentication problem that is proving of having a knowledge to another party without revealing anything other than the veracity of the statement. Zero knowledge proof method is consist of two-way complex mathematical algorithms for both parties. In this work a new method that uses zero knowledge proofs has been proposed to provide efficient solution for Internet of Things technologies. New method was implemented and tested then compared with existing proposed zero knowledge proof based authentication methods.,2017
We investigate the existence of constant-round post-quantum black-box zero-knowledge protocols for NP. As a main result we show that there is no constant-round post-quantum black-box zero-knowledge argument for NP unless NP⊆BQP . As constant-round black-box zero-knowledge arguments for NP exist in the classical setting our main result points out a fundamental difference between post-quantum and classical zero-knowledge protocols. Combining previous results we conclude that unless NP⊆BQP  constant-round post-quantum zero-knowledge protocols for NP exist if and only if we use non-black-box techniques or relax certain security requirements such as relaxing standard zero-knowledge to ϵ -zero-knowledge. Additionally we also prove that three-round and public-coin constant-round post-quantum black-box ϵ -zero-knowledge arguments for NP do not exist unless NP⊆BQP .,2021
Post-quantum digital signature is a critical primitive of computer security in the era of quantum hegemony. As a finalist of the post-quantum cryptography standardization process the theoretical security of the CRYSTALS-Dilithium (Dilithium) signature scheme has been quantified to withstand classical and quantum cryptanalysis. However there is an inherent power side-channel information leakage in its implementation instance due to the physical characteristics of hardware.This work proposes an efficient non-profiled Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) strategy on Dilithium to recover the secret key by targeting the underlying polynomial multiplication arithmetic. We first develop a conservative scheme with a reduced key guess space which can extract a secret key coefficient with a 99.99% confidence using 157 power traces of the reference Dilithium implementation. However this scheme suffers from the computational overhead caused by the large modulus in Dilithium signature. To further accelerate the CPA run-time we propose a fast two-stage scheme that selects a smaller search space and then resolves false positives. We finally construct a hybrid scheme that combines the advantages of both schemes. Real-world experiment on the power measurement data shows that our hybrid scheme improves the attack’s execution time by 7.77×.,2021
Developing and deploying asymmetric cryptographic algorithms that cannot be broken by quantum computers remains critical in cryptography today. Ample research has done on the candidates of NISTs post-quantum cryptography standardization project which is now on its third phase but there remains work to be done. Projects such as Open Quantum Safe have moved on to integrating and benchmarking the algorithms in OpenSSL and other software but their scope is limited. This paper seeks to expand this scope by providing a quantitative analysis of existing key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) while accounting for software and network-related overheads providing a look at the algorithms performance in a way more closely resembling the use cases where they will be deployed. This data is compared to existing data from the ECRYPT project and some vital conclusions about performance are drawn. This work ultimately shows that while useful for benchmarking the simplistic forms of analysis commonly used can misrepresent the algorithms performance.,2020
The emergence of quantum computers has threatened all the areas of internet security and privacy by providing an efficient solution to the underlying mathematical assumptions of the present cryptographic paradigms. The security of current internet applications utilizes this inefficiency in solving the above mathematical problems as a tool for security. One such prominent area where these security paradigms are at utmost core are Block-chains. They build a tamperproof network among trustless peers using these mathematical problems. Quantum attacks to applications utilizing blockchains pose a threat to a market worth 700 million USD. Therefore studies towards quantum secure blockchain are of utmost priority. Crystals Dilithium seems to be promising candidate for post-quantum blockchain security. This article reviews work done on this frontier and conclude Crystals-Dilithium relevance for quantum secure blockchains.,2021
Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have evolved significantly in the last years and their use has been suggested for numerous applications due to their ability to provide transparency redundancy and accountability.

Commitment scheme together with zero-knowledge proof is a fundamental tool for cryptographic design. Recently Baum et al. proposed a commitment scheme (BDLOP) which is by far the most efficient lattice-based one and has been applied on several latest constructions of zero-knowledge proofs. In this paper we propose a more efficient zero-knowledge proof of knowledge for BDLOP commitment opening with a shorter proof. There are a few technical challenges and we develop some new techniques: First we make an adaption of BDLOP commitment by evaluating the opening with the singular value rather than   ℓ2  norm in order to get compact parameters. Then we try to use the bimodal Gaussian technique to minimize the size of the proof. Finally utilizing a modulus-switch technique we can retain the size of the commitment.,2020

Cryptography is essential for the security of online communication cars and implanted medical devices. However many commonly used cryptosystems will be completely broken once large quantum computers exist. Post-quantum cryptography is cryptography under the assumption that the attacker has a large quantum computer; post-quantum cryptosystems strive to remain secure even in this scenario. This relatively young research area has seen some successes in identifying mathematical operations for which quantum algorithms offer little advantage in speed and then building cryptographic systems around those. The central challenge in post-quantum cryptography is to meet demands for cryptographic usability and flexibility without sacrificing confidence.,2017
Abstract—Rapid advances in quantum computing together with the announcement by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to define new standards for digitalsignature encryption and key establishment protocols have created significant interest in post-quantum cryptographic schemes. This paper introduces Kyber (part of CRYSTALS – Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices – a package submitted to NIST post-quantum standardization effort in November 2017) a portfolio of post-quantum cryptographic primitives built around a key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) based on hardness assumptions over module lattices. Our KEM is most naturally seen as a successor to the NEWHOPE KEM (Usenix 2016). In particular the key and ciphertext sizes of our new construction are about half the size the KEM offers CCA instead of only passive security the security is based on a more general (and flexible) lattice problem and our optimized implementation results in essentially the same running time as the aforementioned scheme. We first introduce a CPA-secure public-key encryption scheme apply a variant of the Fujisaki–Okamoto transform to create a CCA-secure KEM and eventually construct in a black-box manner CCA-secure encryption key exchange and authenticated-key-exchange schemes. The security of our primitives is based on the hardness of Module-LWE in the classical and quantum random oracle models and our concrete parameters conservatively target more than 128 bits of postquantum security.,2018
The quantum-resistant attribute is a new design criterion for cryptography algorithms in the era of quantum supremacy. Lattice-based cryptography is proved to be secure against quantum computing. CRYSTALS-Kyber is a lattice-based promising candidate in the post-quantum cryptography standardization process. This paper proposes a high-performance polynomial ring processor for the CRYSTALS-Kyber algorithm. The processor executes optimized polynomial ring arithmetic which cuts off over 20%/50% on the times of modular multiplication/addition compared with the straightforward implementations. Besides the forward and inverse Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) reuse the control logic with the help of an efficient configurable butterfly unit to minimize the area of the finite state machine. Further the underlying dual-column sequential storage scheme breaks the bottleneck of memory accessing. To evaluate the performance a fully pipelined architecture is implemented on a low-cost FPGA platform. Benefiting from these optimizations the Kyber1024 processor can perform NTT operation for a 4-dimensional polynomial vector in 17.1 μs and it achieves speedup by a factor of 2.1 compared with the state-of-the-art implementation.,2021
The traditional centralized digital identity management system (DIMS) has been subject to threats such as fragmented identity single point of failure internal attacks and privacy leakage. Emerging blockchain technology allows DIMSs to be deployed in it which largely alleviates the problems caused by the centralized third party but its inherent transparency and lack of privacy pose a huge challenge to DIMSs. In this regard we leverage the smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) algorithms to improve the existing claim identity model in blockchain to realize the identity unlinkability effectively avoiding the exposure of the ownership of attributes. Furthermore we implement a system prototype named BZDIMS that includes a challenge-response protocol which allows users to selectively disclose their ownership of attributes to service providers to protect users’ behavior privacy. Performance evaluation and security analysis show that our scheme achieves effective attribute privacy protection and a wider application scope compared with the prior model.,2020
Incorporation of connected vehicle (CV) data into real-time traffic management systems presents a host of new challenges resulting from the current lack of data integrity and data privacy in traffic networks. Over the past few years blockchain technologies have been inspiring extensive innovations in the transportation field. However due to the transparency property sensitive data stored on the blockchain would be accessible to anyone resulting in a lack of privacy. In this paper we propose a decentralized and location-aware architecture to address the data integrity along with the privacy-preserving issues in blockchain-based traffic management systems. Our proposed architecture integrates with permissioned and modular blockchain network and non-interactive zero-knowledge range proof (ZKRP) protocol. We develop the prototype system on the Hyperledger Fabric platform and Hyperledger Ursa cryptographic library. The performance results show that our approach is effective and feasible for real-time traffic management while preserving the data privacy requirements.,2020
CRYSTALS-Kyber is a quantum-resistant and promising lattice-based cryptography (LBC) in the finalists of the third round post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standardization which is based on the hardness of Module-Learning with Errors (M-LWE). The variadic parameters make M-LWE obtain a more flexible security-performance trade-off than Ring-LWE. In this paper we propose a M-LWE cryptoprocessor targeting CRYSTALS-Kyber with area-time trade-off for the first time. This balanced design includes a fast and low-cost Binomial Sampler and vector-polynomials multiplication structure based on pipelined decimation-in-frequency (DIF) based Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) technique. The M-LWE cryptoprocessor achieve 27708 encryption operations per second using only 690 slices and 106716 decryption operations per second using only 571 slices. Our proposed design achieved the lowest area-time product (ATP) with at least 2 χ performance improvement than the state-of-the-art LBC designs with a similar security level and complexity of polynomials.,2021
As quantum computers become more affordable and commonplace existing security systems that are based on classical cryptographic primitives such as RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) will no longer be secure. Hence there has been interest in designing post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes such as those based on lattice-based cryptography (LBC). The potential of LBC schemes is evidenced by the number of such schemes passing the selection of NIST PQC Standardization Process Round-3. One such scheme is the Crystals-Dilithium signature scheme which is based on the hard module-lattice problem. However there is no efficient implementation of the Crystals-Dilithium signature scheme. Hence in this article we present a compact hardware architecture containing elaborate modular multiplication units using the Karatsuba algorithm along with smart generators of address sequence and twiddle factors for NTT which can complete polynomial addition/multiplication with the parameter setting of Dilithium in a short clock period. Also we propose a fast software/hardware co-design implementation on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for the Dilithium scheme with a tradeoff between speed and resource utilization. Our co-design implementation outperforms a pure C implementation on a Nios-II processor of the platform Altera DE2-115 in the sense that our implementation is 11.2 and 7.4 times faster for signature and verification respectively. In addition we also achieve approximately 51% and 31% speed improvement for signature and verification in comparison to the pure C implementation on processor ARM Cortex-A9 of ZYNQ-7020 platform.,2021
In this paper we propose a vertical side-channel leakage detection on the decryption function of the third round implementation of CPA-secure public-key encryption scheme underlying CRYSTALS-Kyber a lattice-based key encapsulation mechanism which is a candidate to the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization project. Using a leakage assessment metric we show that the side-channel information can be efficiently used to pinpoint operations leaking the secret variable and how masking countermeasures can be applied. We detect leakages in the polynomial multiplication between the secret key and the ciphertext. We propose and evaluate two different masking countermeasures based on additive and multiplicative masking. To the best of our knowledge the multiplicative masking has not been proposed before as a countermeasure to CRYSTALS-Kyber vulnerabilities. We demonstrate their efficiency and discuss their impact in terms of performance. Our work is beneficial to assess and enhance the security of Post-Quantum Cryptography against advanced vertical side-channel analysis.,2021
Kyber is one of the three finalists of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) post-quantumcryptography competition. This article presents an optimized Very High Speed Integrated Circuit HardwareDescription Language (VHDL)-based implementation of the main components of the Kyber scheme namelyNumber-Theoretic Transform (NTT) and Keccak. We focus specifically on NTT Keccak and their derivativessince they largely determine Kyber’s performance due to their wide involvement in each step of the scheme.Our high-speed implementation also takes into account the trade-off between the degree of parallelization andthe resources utilization. The NTT component is more than 27% faster than the state-of-the-art implementations. Furthermore the optimization helps the algorithm to achieve 1 572 839 NTT operations per second.,2021
This paper presents Dilithium a lattice-based signature scheme that is part of the CRYSTALS (Cryptographic Suite for Algebraic Lattices) package that will be submitted to the NIST call for postquantum standards. The scheme is designed to be simple to securely implement against side-channel attacks and to have comparable efficiency to the currently best lattice-based signature schemes. Our implementation results show that Dilithium is competitive with lattice schemes of the same security level and outperforms digital signature schemes based on other post-quantum assumptions.,2018
The lattice-based CRYSTALS-Dilithium scheme is one of the three third-round digital signature finalists in the National Institute of Standards and TechnologyPost-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process. Due to the complex calcula-tions and highly individualized functions in Dilithium its hardware implementationsface the problems of large area requirements and low efficiency. This paper proposesseveral optimization methods to achieve a compact and high-performance hardwarearchitecture for round 3 Dilithium. Specifically a segmented pipelined processingmethod is proposed to reduce both the storage requirements and the processingtime. Moreover several optimized modules are designed to improve the efficiency ofthe proposed architecture including a pipelined number theoretic transform mod-ule a SampleInBall module a Decompose module and three modular reductionmodules. Compared with state-of-the-art designs for Dilithium on similar platformsour implementation requires1.4×/1.4×/3.0×/4.5×fewer LUTs/FFs/BRAMs/DSPsrespectively and4.4×/1.7×/1.4×less time for key generation signature generationand signature verification respectively for NIST security level 5.,2022
The notion of zero-knowledge [20] is formalized by requiring that for every malicious efficient verifier V * there exists an efficient simulator S that can reconstruct the view of V * in a true interaction with the prover in a way that is indistinguishable to every polynomial-time distinguisher. Weak zero-knowledge weakens this notions by switching the order of the quantifiers and only requires that for every distinguisher D there exists a (potentially different) simulator S D .In this paper we consider various notions of zero-knowledge and investigate whether their weak variants are equivalent to their strong variants. Although we show (under complexity assumption) that for the standard notion of zero-knowledge its weak and strong counterparts are not equivalent for meaningful variants of the standard notion the weak and strong counterparts are indeed equivalent. Towards showing these equivalences we introduce new non-black-box simulation techniques permitting us for instance to demonstrate that the classical 2-round graph non-isomorphism protocol of Goldreich-Micali-Wigderson [18] satisfies a “distributional” variant of zero-knowledge.Our equivalence theorem has other applications beyond the notion of zero-knowledge. For instance it directly implies the dense model theorem of Reingold et al (STOC ’08) and the leakage lemma of Gentry-Wichs (STOC ’11) and provides a modular and arguably simpler proof of these results (while at the same time recasting these result in the language of zero-knowledge).,2015
User authentication is a crucial requirement for secure transactions and access to the sensitive resources on the Web. We propose implement and evaluate a Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication (ZKP) algorithm based on isomorphic graphs. The proposed mechanism allows for authentication with varying confidence and security levels. We suggest that most of the computations should be carried out by the user’s web browser without revealing password or login at any point in time; instead generated random isomorphic graphs and permutation functions based on the user login/password can be exchanged. Our experimental evaluation shows that by combining the asynchronous web with ZKP protocols it is feasible to satisfy existing usability standards on the web.,2008
Our transaction history in the current centralized banking system has the ability to reveal a lot of private information for each spender both to the banking system itself but also to those entities that surround it (e.g. governments industry etc). Examples of leaking information constitute the amounts spent the goods on which the amounts were spent the spending locations and the users we exchange money with. This knowledge is powerful in the hands of those who have it and can be used in multiple ways not always to our benefit. Cryptocurrencies such as the famous Bitcoin were proposed as a means to address the limitations of centralized banking systems and to offer its users privacy with regards to their transactional data. In this work we perform a systematic literature review on the realm of privacy for electronic currencies. We present the development of digital money from electronic cash to cryptocurrencies and focus on the techniques that are employed to enhance user-privacy. Furthermore we present flaws of the current cryptocurrency systems which reduce the privacy of the cryptocurrency users. Finally we describe three research directions to enhance privacy for cryptocurrencies: transaction propagation mechanisms succinct ZK proof systems without a trusted setup and specialised trustless zero-knowledge proofs.,2020
The established cryptographic asymmetric methods are not prepared for possible attacks by a quantum computer and quantum algorithm. The challenge is to define new cryptographic primitives quantum computer resistant security protocols and processes.,2019

"As we are moving into the quantum era classical cryptography is under risk since quantum computers can break these complex cryptographic algorithms. Researchers are developing the post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms to secure the system against quantum computers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started a public evaluation process to standardize quantum-resistant public key algorithms. The objective of this study to provide hardware-based comparison of the NIST Round-2 PQC signature schemes. For this we use a High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design methodology to map high-level C specifcations of signature-based PQC algorithms into FPGA implementations. ",2019
Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic protocols which do not disclose the information or secret itself during the protocol. Zero-knowledge proofs plays an important role in the design of cryptographic protocols. The application of Zero-knowledge protocols can be in authentication identification key exchange and other basic cryptographic operations. Zero-knowledge proof has been implemented without expose any secret information during the conversation and with smaller computational requirement than using comparable public key protocols. The most cryptographic problems can be solved with the help of zero-knowledge protocols as well as with cryptography. Zeroknowledge protocols can be a best solution in many occasions. The Zero-knowledge proof protocols are very lightweight due to which it requires less amount of memory. Thus Zero-knowledge protocols widely used especially in authentication. This paper presents an overview of zero-knowledge protocol used for authentication identification and key exchange.,2015
Port Knocking is a method for authenticating clients through a closed stance firewall and authorising their requested actions enabling severs to offer services to authenticated clients without opening ports on the firewall. Advances in port knocking have resulted in an increase in complexity in design preventing port knocking solutions from realising their potential. This paper proposes a novel port knocking solution named Crucible which is a secure method of authentication with high usability and features of stealth allowing servers and services to remain hidden and protected. Crucible is a stateless solution only requiring the client memorise a command the server’s IP and a chosen password. The solution is forwarded as a method for protecting servers against attacks ranging from port scans to zero-day exploitation. To act as a random oracle for both client and server cryptographic hashes were generated through chaotic systems.,2020
This work introduces a new interactive oracle proof system based on the MPC-in-theHead paradigm. To improve concrete efficiency and offer flexibility between computation time and communication size a generic proof construction based on multi-round MPC protocols is proposed instantiated with a specific protocol and implemented and compared to similar proof systems. Performance gains over previous work derive from a multi-party multiplication check optimized for the multi-round and MPC-in-the-Head settings. Of most interest among implementation optimizations is the use of identical randomness across repeated MPC protocol executions in order to accelerate computation without excessive cost to the soundness error.The new system creates proofs of SHA-256 pre-images of 43KB in 53ms with 16 MPC parties or 23KB in 188ms for 128 parties. As a signature scheme the non-interactive variant produces signatures based on the AES-128 circuit of 18KB in about 4ms; this is 20% faster and 32 % larger than the Picnic3 scheme (13kB in 5.3ms for 16 parties) which is based on the 90% smaller LowMC circuit.,2021
Shor’s shockingly fast quantum algorithm for solving the period-finding problem is a threat for the most common public-key primitives as it can be efficiently applied to solve both the Integer Factorisation Problem and the Discrete Logarithm Problem. In other words as soon as a large-enough quantum computer is born many once-secure protocols have to be replaced by still-secure alternatives. Instead of relying for example on the RSA protocol the Diffie-Hellman key-exchange or the (Elliptic Curve) Digital Signature Algorithm many researchers moved their attention to the design and analysis of primitives which are yet to be broken by quantum algorithms.The urgency of the threat imposed by quantum computers led the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to open calls for both Post-Quantum Public-Keys Exchange Algorithms and Post-Quantum Digital Signature Algorithms [32]. This new NIST standardisation process started in 2016 has involved hundreds of researchers has seen 37 early submissions for a total of 82 proposals and has recently reached its third round of analyses.In this brief survey we focus on the round 3 finalists and alternate candidates for Digital Signatures announced on July 22 2020:These schemes are designed to address distinct security levels known as Security LevelI III and V. These levels correspond to respectively 128 192 and 256 bits of security against collisions. Among the six schemes above only Falcon cannot be instantiated to all three security levels. In order to present these primitives we start in Section 1 with an introduction to their underlying mathematical objects and the related problems i.e. lattices polynomial ideals one-way functions and zero-knowledge proofs. Then Section 2 describes the six digital signatures and lists their algorithms for key-generation signing and verification. Finally in Section 3 we conclude with a comparison between the different schemes.,2021

Cryptography is an unexpected revolution in information security in the recent decades where remarkable improvements have been created to provide confidentiality and integrity. Quantum cryptography is one such improvement that has grown rapidly since the first announced protocol. Quantum cryptography contains substantial elements that must be addressed to ensure secure communication between legitimate parties. Quantum key distribution (QKD) a technique for creating a secret key is one of the most interesting areas in quantum cryptography. This paper reviews some well-known quantum key distribution techniques that have been demonstrated in the past three decades. Furthermore this paper discusses the process of creating a secret key using quantum mechanics and cryptography methods. Moreover it explains the relationships between many basic aspects of QKD protocols and suggests some improvements in the cryptosystem. An accurate quantitative comparison between the QKD protocols is presented especially the runtime execution for each QKD protocol. In addition the paper will demonstrate a general model of each considered QKD protocol based on security principles.,2022
Fiat-Shamir with aborts is a technique to transform a latticebased identification scheme to a signature scheme introduced by Lyubashevsky (in Asiacrypt 2009). The scheme is also provably secure based on some standard lattice problems. In this paper we show how to generically transform a signature scheme obtained by Fiat-Shamir transformation from the ring learning with errors problem (RLWE) to a ring signature. The ring signature obtained with this transformation possesses standard security notions like unforgeability and anonymity. We also show how to achieve a linkable ring signature from the ring signature using a collisionresistant hash function. Linkable ring signatures are an important cryptographic tool as it protects signer anonymity and link signatures from the same signer. The linkable ring signature obtained from this transformation performs at par with the other lattice-based solutions for linkable ring signature which does not require high-end zero-knowledge proofs.,2020
"The Fiat-Shamir paradigm encompasses many different ways of turning a given identification scheme into a signature scheme. Security proofs pertain sometimes to one variant, sometimes to another. We systematically study three variants that we call the challenge (signature is challenge and response), commit (signature is commitment and response), and transcript (signature is challenge, commitment and response) variants. Our framework captures the variants via transforms that determine the signature scheme as a function of not only the identification scheme and hash function (to cover both standard and random oracle model hashing), but also what we call a signing algorithm, to cover both classical and with-abort signing. We relate the security of the signature schemes produced by these transforms, giving minimal conditions under which uf-security of one transfers to the other. To apply this comprehensively, we formalize linear identification schemes, show that many schemes in the literature are linear, and show that any linear scheme meets our conditions for the signature schemes given by the three transforms to have equivalent uf-security. Our results give a comprehensive picture of the Fiat-Shamir zoo and allow proofs of security in the literature to be transferred automatically from one variant to another.",2018
