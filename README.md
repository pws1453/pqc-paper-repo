# Trend Analyzing Algorithm for [Paper]
## An Overview
This script is designed to mine the abstracts in the 'abstracts.csv' file, to find common words or phrases within them. These abstracts will be separated by the year. Keyphrases or keywords will only be recorded if they occur in more than one paper, as to avoid recording words or phrases unique to a single paper. 

## Respository Architecture
`paper-sorted` contains the curated csvs that were used to derive certain figures in the paper.

`unsorted-sanitized` contain the csvs generated by the python script, which will sanitize the `abstracts.csv` file, in order to perform frequency analysis.

## Procedures used
To derive the results located in the 'unsorted-sanitized', run the script. 

The CSVs provided in the 'paper-sorted' folder were processed additionally. To create these files, we accounted for plural or alternate forms of words by adding the instances of these forms to the root word.
